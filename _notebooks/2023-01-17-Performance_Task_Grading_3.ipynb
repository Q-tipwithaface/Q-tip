    "## Failed to meet the standards\n",
    "For these four examples, a submission is most likely to fail to meet the standard by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, code segments, or the entire program or by not explaining how a program functions. Defining a program's funciton is not the same as defining the program's purpose. There also must be an understanding of code so that they can be split up to fill in the part of the response that needs code. If you understand the code, them the code present in the response should earn you the points."
