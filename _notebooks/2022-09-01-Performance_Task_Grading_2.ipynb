    "## Failed to meet the standards\n",
    "For these four examples, a submission is most likely to fail to meet the standard by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, code segments, or the entire program or by not explaining how a program functions. Defining a program's funciton is not the same as defining the program's purpose and that misunderstanding will cost 1 point. There also must be a clear step by step porcess on how to recreate one of the pieces of code in the program to show a person's coding skills and to be able to earn a 1 for its category."
