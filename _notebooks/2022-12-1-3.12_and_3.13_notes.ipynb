    "Procedure can or can no return a value. Values include numbers and booleans. Procedure works similarly to a function. Defining the procedure calls it along with setting its parameters. Parameter is the value(s) that would be used in the procedure to determine the output. Procedures have the ability to change the result without changing the calls to the program.\n",

    "In java, you call a prodecure by defining its function. Defining the function allows values to change the parameters, resulting in a new outcome. Those new values are normally inputed by the coder in the code, not in a input, but it can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Abstraction provides a name for a process that makes it so a procedure can be used knowing what it does. Kind of like defining a function. This allows the code to use the procedure in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity is used to help identiy any sort of issues that arise in the code. It breaks down the code, making the error easier to see."

    "## <mark>Homework/Hacks</mark>: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
