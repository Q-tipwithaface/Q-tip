    "<span style=\"color:blue\">We use DNS so that we can have ability to use websites, services, and platforms on a computer locally without the use of a set IP address. Instead of the IP address, a domain name is used. DNS works by getting a device connected to a network and then changes the IP address of that device into a new IP address in order to visit different websites or platforms locally. Duck DNS is different from other DNSs because it allows users to create their own customizable domain that can even have subdomains. Duck DNS is useful for our projects because we can access our other network devices without needing to know the IP address or the service's network settings. To set up Duck DNS, you need to sign in at duckdns.org using your google or github account. Secondly, type in a custom name for a domain and press 'add domain'. Then, change the corresponding IP address to a new one that will be used. Finally, click the update button. Now a website can be accessed locally using the set domain instead of its IP address.<span>\n",

    "- 4 - In 2-3 complete sentences, talk about any outdated Nginx/Docker functionalities that may need to be addressed or any confusions you may have in regards to the deployment process from Trimesters 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">During the deployment process from trimesters 1 and 2, both Nginx and Docker were up to date so there was no outdated functionalities that occurred from them. However, it is best to address the outdated functionalities as old code doesn't work well if at all with more updated code that it used to replace it or add additional features and with the lack of updates that are used to improve security, fix bugs, and make sure everything is still running, a website might not work.</span>\n",

    "### Alternatives to Certbot Hacks (I was unable to install and set up Certbot)\n",
    "Research and compare the security features of OpenSSL and LibreSSL, and write about the recent vulnerabilities within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">OpenSSL and LibreSSL are very similar as they are both made to manage and to create a connection with an application and data. However, they are different in the fact that OpenSSL is more feature-oriented while LibreSSL is more security-based. OpenSSL is designed to be used as an easy way for programmers to create applications. This resulted in OpenSSL focusing more about the tool's features and accessibility and less about the security of the code. While the security for OpenSSL is good, it is more likely to have an attack compared to LibreSSL. LibreSSL is designed to provide safer connection between data and for maintainng a clean space. I manages a clean space by remove unnecessary and/or outdated code. This results in LibreSSL being more security-based by limiting the features it allows. OpenSSL and LibreSSL is a sort of trade off. However, both have revealed vulnerabilities as attackers were able to cause a denial-of-service attack by sending one of the SSLs a certificate request that would cause it to loop, cutting a connection between multiple devices. Lucky, that bug was fixed for both SSLs but still revealed flaws in their security.</span>"
