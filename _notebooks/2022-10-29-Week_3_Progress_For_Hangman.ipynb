    "- Space for unknown word to be shown\n",
    "    - The program now has a place where the secret word will be displayed. The display space will be determined by the amount of characters in the word. For example, the word \"input\" would be first displayed as \" _ _ _ _ _ \" where as the word \"output\" would be first displayed as \" _ _ _ _ _ _ \".\n",
    "- Space for guessed incorrect answers\n",
    "    - The program has an area that displays letters that are not present in the secret word that were also guessed by the user. If the user has already guessed the incorrect letter and choices it again, the program will remain them that they have already guessed that word and leave the amount of body parts the same.\n",
    "- A more presentable program\n",
    "    - More detailed images have been created that display the hanged man and the gallow. Each image displays the different stages of the hangman's growth."

Right before we finish and mark the code as complete, we will go around the classroom and ask others for their feedback. We will take in this feedback and use it to make any final corrections and then mark the hangman program as complete. "
