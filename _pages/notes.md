Weekly Progess

Week 1: Doing a Bash test, Update Fastpage

Week 2: A personal schedule was created and features including tags and search become more usable in fastpages. I also learned how to use InfoDb records and List of dictionaries in oreder to hold infomation.

Week 3: Used block coding to gain an understanding of how it works and how code is used to create apps.

Week 4: Created a local server using flask and a local fastpage server and gained knowledge about the importance of collaboration.

Week 5: Customized local flask server and fastpages and assigned roles to each team member for the group project.

Week 6: Launched a group terminal in AWS with our local flask servers and brainstormed more ideas for our group project.
