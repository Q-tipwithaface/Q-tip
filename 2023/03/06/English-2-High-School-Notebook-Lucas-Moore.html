<p><strong>I am a teenager trying to find my place in high school and beyond.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I wonder what challenges I will need to overcome in order to obtain my dreams.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I hear myself thinking about if my work is good enough.</strong><img src="https://Q-tipwithaface.github.io/Q-tip/assets/img/2023-03-06-English-2-High-School-Notebook-Lucas-Moore/media/image18.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>I see myself trying and learning new experiences.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I want a bright and successful future.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am a teenager trying to find my place in high school and beyond.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I pretend to understand what my Spanish teacher is saying.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I feel proud that I had good grades so far.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I touch my cellphone when I’m bored of studying.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I worry that this trimester will be harder than the last one.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I cry when I feel overwhelmed with stress about school work.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am a teenager trying to find my place in high school and beyond.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I understand that honest and hard work is the best work to complete.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I say that I belong here in this school.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I dream of success and the feeling of accomplishment.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I try to make sure I have done everything right.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I hope it will be enough.</strong></p>

<p>Hero’s Journey/Character Archetype Paragraph Date: 12/2/2021 Assign #6</p>

<p><strong><span class="underline">Writing a Two Chunk: Use this handout (it will ensure that you have all of the parts)</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Support Thesis (aka Topic Sentence)– i.e. In the movie __, the character __ becomes a hero when __ (one of the stages).</strong></p>

<p>In the movie <em>Wreck it Ralph</em>, the character Ralph displays the archetype hero when he faces obstacles that change and grow him as a person. Initially, Ralph is lonely, isolated, and misunderstood. He wants to be accepted and not seen as the bad guy anymore in his video game. He jumps into another video game to prove to everyone that he could be a hero by winning the prized medal. However, he ends up being transported to Sugar Rush Land where he meets Penelope. This is significant because Penelope plays a big part of Ralph’s evolution. She brings out traits and emotions in him that he never knew he had, such as: playfulness, protectiveness, love, and trustworthiness. She makes him realize that it’s better to have a true friend than a trophy.</p>

<p><strong>Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #1 (you may paraphrase or quote the movie):</strong></p>

<p>During the climax of the movie, Ralph sends himself and hundreds of mentos into a volcano of hot coke knowing that it would kill him but would also end up killing the Cy-bugs that were terrorizing Sugar Rush.</p>

<p><span class="underline"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Commentary <em>(2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”)</em></strong></p>

<p>This part of the movie is important because it proves that Ralph is the hero. In a movie that uses the hero’s journey, the definition of a hero is the character that needs to overcome an obstacle that ends up changing the character. In the beginning of the story, Ralph was selfish because he only wanted a medal so that he could get the approval from his co-workers. However, later on, he realized that having true friends is better than approval and that it is better to actually be a better person. This heroic act of sacrificing himself for the greater good displays the role of hero.</p>

<p><strong>Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #2:</strong></p>

<p>Another example of when Ralph represents actions of a hero is when he learned that Penelope’s racing could cause her to lose her life. In order for this to not happen, Ralph decided that the best course of action was to destroy her racing car.</p>

<p><strong>Commentary <em>(2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”)</em></strong></p>

<p>While this seems like a cruel act to do, he displays archetype hero traits of protection and love. Heroes often are faced with making hard decisions that may hurt people, but they do it with good intentions. Ralph destroyed Penelope’s car because he didn’t want to lose his only friend and would rather risk their friendship than her life. This is a selfless act often seen by archetypal heroes.</p>

<p><strong>Concluding Sentence</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, Ralph is an archetypal hero in Wreck it Ralph because he evolves from being a self-centered lonely character to one that would sacrifice everything he values for the greater good.</p>

<td><h1 id="do-heroes-make-us-smarter">Do Heroes Make Us Smarter?</h1>
<h2 id="heroes-give-us-direction-wisdom-and-emotional-intelligence.">Heroes give us direction, wisdom, and emotional intelligence.</h2>
<p>By Scott T. Allison, Ph.D., <em>Psychology Today</em>, Apr 13, 2014</p>
<p>When legendary South African President Nelson Mandela passed away in 2013, the world responded with heartache mixed with reverence. President Barack Obama observed that Mandela “no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages.” With this statement, Obama illustrated what we have always done to our greatest heroes—we forge them in eternity.</p>
<p>Why do we idolize great heroic leaders? Obviously, heroes provide us with hope and inspiration. But my research on heroes reveals a surprising finding—they make us smarter, too. Heroes improve our intelligence about the world and teach us lessons about the trajectory of our own lives. Our research has uncovered four ways that heroes impart wisdom to us.</p>
<p><strong>1. Heroes teach us how to respond in crisis situations</strong></p>
<p>In 2007, Wesley Autrey, a construction worker living in Harlem, received international acclaim when he rescued a complete stranger from an oncoming New York subway train. Autrey witnessed the man fall on the subway tracks just as a train was approaching. Realizing he had no time to move the man from the tracks, Autrey made the remarkable decision to lie down on top of him in-between the rails as the train passed over them both. Only one-half inch separated Autrey from severe injury or death.</p>
<p>After performing this heroic act, Autrey received hundreds of letters from people thanking him for showing them how to live their lives and how to respond in emergency situations. Autrey and other selfless heroes like him teach us what to do, and the right thing to do, in challenging situations. Heroes like Autrey provide a script for heroic action to a world hungry for such a script.</p>
<p><strong>2. Hero stories illuminate paradoxical life truths</strong></p>
<p>Spiritual guru Richard Rohr argues that hero stories are saturated with complex life truths that are nearly impossible for humans to grasp unless they are illustrated inside a good hero story. Many of these truths are paradoxical secrets of human growth and development. For example, in a typical hero story, the hero cannot grow as a person until after he or she has experienced a significant falling or failing. “Where you stumble,” wrote comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, “there lies your treasure.” Other paradoxical truths in hero stories include the wisdom that (a) we must leave home to find home; (b) we must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; (c) we must surrender to win; and (d) we must give up something important to gain something important.</p>
<p><strong>3. Heroes teach us that their journey is the human journey</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Campbell believed that the Hero’s Journey parallels human developmental stages. All young adults are driven out of their safe, familiar worlds and into the fearful real world. Psychologist Eric Erikson’s stages of human lifespan development suggest a hero trajectory during our lives, with young adults driven to establish competencies and carve out an identity for themselves.</p>
<p>Older adults reach a stage of generativity, which Erikson defines as people’s desire to create things that will outlast them and to give back to the society that has given them so much. Hero stories teach us that we are all developmentally equipped to pursue a lifelong hero-like journey.</p>
<p><strong>4. Heroes help us develop emotional intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim believed that children’s fairy tales are useful in helping people, especially children, understand emotional experience. The heroes of these fairy tales are usually subjected to dark, foreboding experiences, such as encounters with witches, evil spells, abandonment, neglect, abuse, and death. Listeners to these tales develop strategies for resolving their fears and distress.</p>
<p>Bettelheim believed that even the most distressing fairy tales, such as those by the Brothers Grimm, add clarity to confusing emotions and give people a greater sense of life’s meaning and purpose. The darkness of fairy tales allows children to grow emotionally, thus developing their emotional intelligence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Heroes give us far more than inspiration—they are our greatest teachers. Heroes show us the secrets to unlocking our fullest potential as human beings. They do so by role-modeling virtue, by clarifying complex and paradoxical life truths, by equipping us with emotional intelligence, and by revealing how their journey can be our journey, too. No wonder Obama said that Nelson Mandela “belongs to the ages.” The wisdom we get from our heroes has a timeless quality that helps us thrive as human beings.</p></td>

<p>What have you learned from the article?</p>

<p>What I learned from the article is that heros make us smarter because they teach us how to respond to a crisis, reflect real life truths and problems, relate to us by comparing a hero’s journey to a human’s, and by creating emotions that help us respond to certain situations.</p>

<p>What kind of text is this article?</p>

<p>This article is a narrative text.</p>

<p>What type of Evidence does the writer provide?</p>

<p>The writer provides expert opinions, historic events, and research.</p>

<p>How does this text add to your understanding of heroes and heroism?</p>

<p>The text makes me understand why most hero stories are made, the writers want the readers, watchers, or listeners to grow. Whether that be by teaching them about how to handle a crisis, think about life truths and problems, and/or grow emotionally.</p>

<p>Based on this article, why do you think the hero’s journey appeals to the human psyche?</p>

<p>Based on the article, the hero’s journey appeals to the human psyche because humans want to leave something behind when they are gone and the hero’s journey’s most common reward is being remembered for something great. That is just what humans want.</p>

<p>Give an example of someone who you believe is heroic and how this person has guided you.</p>

<p>I believe that both my parents are heroic because they have put me before themselves. They have guided me to becoming a better person by making me more selfless.</p>

<td><p>Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92.</p>
<p>Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for ''M.''</p>
<p>But Ms. Atkins's steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny's lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins's heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France.</p>
<p>After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money.</p>
<p>''I could not just abandon their memory,'' she said. ''I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.''</p>
<p>She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. ''I was probably the only person who could do this,'' she said. ''You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.''</p>
<p>The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess's reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz.</p>
<p>''Oh no,'' he said, as if offended. ''It was 2,345,000.''</p>
<p>Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother's last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up ''to set Europe ablaze'' through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ''It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.''</p>
<p>Hitler said, ''When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.''</p>
<p>Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster's assistant, Ms. Atkins.</p>
<p>The spymasters headed the unit's F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it.</p>
<p>The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens.</p>
<p>The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester.</p>
<p>They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds.</p>
<p>It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets.</p>
<p>At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a ''sledgehammer,'' pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive.</p>
<p>One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, ''Road to Resistance,''( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. ''Oh, the bloody English!'' she said. ''We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.''</p>
<p>Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its title from her first name.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987.</p>
<p>She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see France.</p>
<p><em><strong>Editors' Note:</strong> July 14, 2000, Friday An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times's research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications. Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins's background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins's retirement.

<td><p>Vera Atkin was a hero and now she is dead.</p>
<p>While Ms Atkins may have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny, Ms Atkins steps into the action when needed.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkin shared her heart with all her agents, not just one.</p>
<p>&lt;--This paragraph connects to the fact that Ms. Atkin cares about all her agents. She pushed herself to find the missing ones, even most likely knowing that they were dead.</p>
<p>Historic figure, a very effective piece of evidence because it is coming from the person the article is about.</p>
<p>Ms Atkin’s way of growing up made her have the tools needed for her future work.</p>
<p>The evidence coming from a historic figure explains that the special operations could be a success.</p>
<p>Even through Hitler didn’t know about Ms. Atkins. She was a big help in stopping his progress.</p>
<p>This was the agent’s tests and the agent’s rank.</p>
<p>The fact that she had no rank shows that Ms Atkins was dedicated to her work even if she was overshadowed.</p>
<p>Historic figure, an effective piece of evidence because it is coming from one of the Ms. Atkins’ agents.</p>
<p>Ms. Atkians didn’t want her agent's lives to go to waste.</p></td>

  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Romeo and Juliet’s lines combined create a sonnet. Why would Shakespeare choose to make the first encounter between Romeo and Juliet a sonnet? Shakespeare chose to use a sonnet because whenever Shakespeare uses a sonnet, it is telling the audience that something important is going on. And this is true because the first time Romeo and Juilet meet is important because it drives the story and eventually leads to both the lovers’ death.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Look at the sonnet. What do you notice about how the lines of the sonnet are broken between Romeo and Juliet? Why is it broken up this way, what does it show?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sonnet is just about broken up evenly between the two. This is meant to show that Romeo and Juliet are connected and foreshadowing them becoming lovers.</p>

      <p>Why is there so much religious imagery? Why would Shakespeare connect Romeo and Juliet’s love to religion?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shakespeare connects Romeo and Juliet’s love to religion because their love was tied to their faith of both of them dying for each other. Many religions include faith as a major belief.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Romeo defends his logic on love by claiming that Rosaline never truly loved him and he found someone who truly loved him back. Friar thinks that Roseline scorned Romeo because he thought Romeo was so committed to making Rosaline love him that the only way Romeo would leave her was if she broke his heart. This type of conflict is inner conflict because it is Romeo vs his own passion for Juliet. I think Romeo is right to let Rosaline go because their relationship would never have worked out because it lacked true love.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Highlight the Friar’s warning in his final line. How is his warning similar to Juliet’s in Act 2.2 “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;/ Too like the lightning which doth cease to be” (Act 2.2 lines 129-130)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Romeo is explaining to Benvolio that even though the fight was filled with hate, it was caused by love. Both of the families’ servants fought because in their mind, it was what they needed to do in order to protect the family and for them to show their love.</p>

<p>Madam, I am not well.</p>

<p>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?</p>
<p>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</p>

<p>Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET</p>
<p>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,</p>
<p>As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.</p>
<p>JULIET</p>
<p>What villain madam? 15</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET</p>
<p>That same villain, Romeo.</p>
<p>JULIET</p>
<p>[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--</p>
<p>God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;</p>
<p>And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET</p>
<p>That is, because the traitor murderer lives. 20</p>
<p>JULIET</p>
<p>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</p>
<p>Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!</p>
<p>LADY CAPULET</p>
<p>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</p>
<p>Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,</p>
<p>Where that same banish'd runagate doth live, 25</p>
<p>Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,</p>
<p>That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:</p>
<p>And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</p>
<p>JULIET</p>
<p>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</p>
<p>With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--</p>
<p>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd</p>
<p>Madam, if you could find out but a man</p>
<p>To bear a poison, I would temper it;</p>
<p>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</p>
<p>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors 35</p>

  <p>Romeo directly talking to death affects the way the audience sees him. Romeo, who is so excited to take on the world in the first part of the play is now begging death to take him to Juliet. This shows that Juliet is now Romeo’s world and that Romeo would do anything to get back to it.</p>

<p>Summary: Juliet: It is not morning and you are leaving already?</p>

<p>Romeo: I must leave because if I do not, I will be found in broad daylight and I will be killed ________________by the prince’s men.</p>

<p>Level 2 Questions</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>How does Juliet attempt to change the world through language?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Juliet attempts to change the world through language by making the world sound like a safer place. By doing this, Romeo might stay with Juliet a little longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Compare and contrast this scene to the balcony scene (2.2). Think about what Romeo thought when he saw Juliet? Explain what he thought. What is Juliet trying to do here?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Romeo saw Juliet in the balcony in act 2 scene 2, he referred to her as a holy person with great beauty, like an angel. In this act, Juliet is trying to convince Romeo to stay with her for a little longer. This is Juliet calling for a person he needs, which makes it now Juliet referring to Romeo as an angel.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What theme is being developed in this scene? A theme is a single word. What is the message that Shakespeare is developing in this scene? In other words, write a “themessage.”</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The theme of “loss.” Shakespeare develops the message that hatern can cause a person to be separated from you and love can make that separation feel like a loss.</p>

<p><strong>Write your commentary.</strong></p>

<p>What is the message that this quote supports? Love creates bonds that affect the actions of others.</p>

<p>Level 1 Commentary: The lines are about Juliet begging Romeo to stay with her in order to feel safer and because it might be the last time she would even see him.</p>

<p>Level 2 Commentary: Before Juliet met Romeo, she was a smart young woman that thought things through, but now that bonds have been formed between the two, Juliet’s love is taking actions in order to make Romeo stay, and in ways that she would have never done before.</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>What if Shakespeare had it wrong about love in <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>? In fact, what if all of us have it wrong and our ideals of love and romance are hopelessly awry? Although we are supposed to be celebrating our love for that special someone on Valentine's Day, perhaps the time has come to reconsider the concept of romantic love, at least as it has been conceived in Western societies.</p>
<p>As we busily track down red roses, the best chocolates and the finest champagnes, we need to ask whether, in the pursuit of the perfect romance, we haven't declared war on true love. Cupid's arrow does strike often, but with the U.S. divorce rate near 50%, one has to wonder whether the wound is particularly deep or long-lasting. (Love)</p>
<p>As I found when researching my book on the science of human attraction, our typical romantic beliefs are quite often wrong. For instance, even couples who are blissfully happy together can't count on a happy ending. The PAIR project, a long-term academic study of couples, found that those most in love when they marry are also the most likely to get divorced.</p>
<p>And the chemical attraction that many people rely on to choose a partner has been found to fade "to neutrality" in two to three years. That's right, neutrality, which might work well for Switzerland but is deadly for a marriage.</p>
<p>Perhaps most damning of all, I discovered that wife murderers tend to be strong subscribers to the romantic ideal. Take that, Romeo and Juliet.</p>
<p>Love and romance did not always rule the roost. As recently as the 1930s, American men ranked mutual attraction as only the fourth most important quality for a relationship, while women had it even lower, placing it fifth (in a 1956 survey, women dropped it all the way to sixth). But in recent decades, love has climbed to No. 1, accompanied by a rise in the importance of looks, which suggests that our romance with romance is long on style and short on substance.</p>
<p>I hate to sound unromantic on this day of all days, but perhaps it's time to place less emphasis on romantic attraction as the key to finding a partner. What can shoulder some of the load? I would suggest that we rely a little more on what science has discovered about human attraction.</p>
<p>For instance, some researchers can now predict whether a couple will stay together with far more accuracy than the couple themselves. And it has less to do with the things we might think, such as fighting, and far more to do with the things we take for granted, such as asking your spouse about his or her day.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean we need to jettison every aspect of chemical attraction. Several studies have found that for women, a man's body odor is a helpful guide to finding a good genetic match (but only if the woman is not taking an oral contraceptive, which reverses her usual smell preferences). Body odor doesn't sound very romantic, but perhaps the better question to ask is: How did our narrow ideal of romantic love come to hold such complete sway in the first place?</p>
<p>Imagine a dating world turned on its head, in which people were not given the freedom to opt into or out of a relationship -- such as a culture that practices arranged marriages. What researchers have found will be shocking to Westerners weaned on the idea of romantic love.</p>
<p>According to a 1982 study by two Indian researchers, the level of self-reported love in arranged marriages increased over time until they surpassed the level of self-reported love in marriages that were freely chosen. Incredible as it sounds, people with a very limited say in choosing their own spouses eventually became happier with their relationships than people with the freedom to choose anyone they wanted.</p>
<p>Although we almost always read <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> as the quintessential story of love at first sight, Shakespeare actually offered his own sly critique of romantic love at the beginning of the play. Romeo is pining away for love -- but not for Juliet. There is another fair damsel who has rejected Romeo's advances, and he declares himself inconsolable. He disdains finding someone else and tells Benvolio, "Thou canst not teach me to forget" -- which is, of course, precisely what happens a few scenes later when Romeo meets Juliet and realizes that he was completely wrong before and only <em>now</em> has discovered true love.</p>
<p>We never remember that part of the story, though, because if we think of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> from that perspective, the whole play starts to skew in ways that contradict our usual romantic notions.</p>
<p>Perhaps the time has come for us to take a skeptical view of romance, particularly the over-the-top variety peddled so effectively on Valentine's Day. We should throw off the shackles of our reigning romantic orthodoxy and realize that <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and its many cultural offspring have led us astray. Shakespeare's story may be transcendent entertainment, but it is disastrous dating advice.</p>

<p><strong>Hero’s Journey Journal Date: 12/6/2021</strong></p>

<p>In the video, I learned that people in the future could look at today’s superheroes and think of them as our culture. This also made me wonder if we are looking at past cultures in the same way that future cultures might be looking at us. It made me wonder if people hundreds or even thousands of years ago were as attached to their gods, legends, or heros as people of today are to theirs. Heros can show the value of a culture because heroes are looked at as an ideal or the best a person can be. People who look up to a hero also want to be as good as them or at least the best they themself can be. This is the reason heroes were made and why many people inbrance their ideas, heroes bring out the best part of a person. A person showing the best part of themself could become a real life hero and can make the world better and safer.</p>

<p><strong>Journal #2 Date: 1/4/2022</strong></p>

<p>Courage is possibly the most common trait for a hero. Courage is going after something and knowing that the journey to it will be dangerous and that you might end up failing. The heroic part about courage is that the hero knows that what they are doing is dangerous but <strong>chooses</strong> to continue on the journey because they are doing it for the greater good. A person that is courageous is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. He chose to go into the death star to save princess Leia knowing he and his group were outnumbered and were mostly likely going to be overpowered. He even went back to help the rebels blow up the death star, still being outnumbered and overpowered. Luke did this because it was for the greater good and was worth the risk. Everyday people teach us that we want someone that has greater traits such as courage to be a leader and a face for our community.</p>

<p><strong>Journal #5</strong></p>

<p>“There is no lonelier man in death, except the suicide, than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her. If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.” – Ernest Hemingway</p>

<p>What Ernest is saying is that when someone loses their love, they become lonely. Love will never have a happy ending because no one can escape death and the lovers’ separation would lead to depression for the longer lasting lover and a tragic ending. This happened when Juliet kills herself after seeing Romeo dead(3.5.3122-3137). Juliet’s end is a tragic one because of the loss causing her to become depressed.</p>

<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> In the play Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare’s view of love contains a strong theme of hatred by displaying through the characters that love and hate are more connected than people realize and how love overpowers hate.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Sentence 1:</strong> Shakespeare develops the message of love and hate being closely connected by</p>

<p>displaying the external conflicts the characters have towards each other.</p>

<p>showing a battle filled with hatred between the Capulets and the Montagues but fueled by love for their families.</p>

<p><strong>Topic Sentence 2:</strong> Shakespere develops the message of love overpowering hate by displaying the internal conflicts inside of the characters and demonstrating how their love and hate battle is out.</p>

<p>displaying that the love Juliet had for Romeo outshone the hate she had for him even after Romeo killed her cousin Tybalt.</p>

<p>through the love the characters have for each other.</p>

<p>by displaying that it is the result of the love the characters have towards each other.</p>

<p><strong>Vocabulary Development</strong></p>

<p>Keep track of vocabulary words that are new to you. Research says that the best way to develop one’s vocabulary is to read. However, if you do not try to make words your own as you read, reading will not develop your vocabulary. Keeping this in mind, you will keep track of words that you learn as you read.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Find 2-3 words per reading that you don’t know or that you’re not quite sure about.</p>
