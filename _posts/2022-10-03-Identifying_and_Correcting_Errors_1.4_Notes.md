<li>What errors may arise in your project?<ul>
<li>In program development, many errors eccour but most of them are small. These small errors could be an incorrect line of code, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. Just to keep in mind, all of these errors can break the entire code so ALL ERRORS MUST BE FIXED in our code.</li>
