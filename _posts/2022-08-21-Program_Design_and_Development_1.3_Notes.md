<h2 id="My-Group-Project-Info:">My Group Project Info:<a class="anchor-link" href="#My-Group-Project-Info:"> </a></h2><p><mark>Main Idea about the Project:</p>
<p>Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win.</p>
<p><mark>Purpose of Program:</p>
<p>The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user's vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer.</p>
<p><mark>Brainstormed Ideas:</p>
<p>The game is going to be like traditional hangman but there are ideas that will make the coding more interesting and make it more fun for the user.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Timer: A timer can be added to the game to make it feel more fast paced. A timer will reset every time the user guesses a letter, no matter if it is right or wrong. If the timer finishes before the user guesses, it will automatically draw a body part and reset.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition: A text box of the definition of the unknown word will appear. This definition will guide the user into guessing the correct word.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><mark>Requirements and Constraints:</p>
<p>The requirement is to create a program with a eductional purpose and present it in class by the end of the trimester.</p>
