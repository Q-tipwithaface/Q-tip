# Other Art From Other Classes

## 3D Animation
3D Animation is a computer art class that uses blender to create pieces of art. Below is a printed out image of a render featuring a scene that puts emphasis on a donut. This piece uses different elements of art and principles of desgin in order for the whole thing to act as one. Those are the things that make this type of work art.

## Ceramics
Ceramics is an art class that uses clay to build unique objects that can express their own artistic style. Below is an image of a pot that looks like the IMP emoji. The design of this pot makes use of the horns and the top of its head as handles. This is a good piece not just because of the style but its functionality.

## Drawing and Painting
Drawing and Painting is using a canvas to draw or paint to express an unlimited amount of style and/or emotion. Below is an image of a cat with a unique style that gets the impression of a broken reflection. This piece diplays more about the artist than any other piece because it shows their preferred style, their likes and dislikes, and their skill.
