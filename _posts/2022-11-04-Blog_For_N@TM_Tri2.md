# Improvements and New Ideas for the Next Trimester

## Improvements
For this Trimester, my group's theme was food and builted a website based on it. Each of us contributed to the website by making a section that was individually created. This allowed us each to grow and become less dependent of each other as we were coding. However, we were not fully independent. Near the end of the creation of the project, most of the sections were still having problems. When one of us tried to ask for help from the others, the other three team members were unable to help not just because they had their own code to work on but because they didn't know how the asker's code worked. Each member had not had an understanding of how their teammates code worked and resulted in less team collaboration. For the next project in the next trimester, my team and I will need to REMIND each other to look at each others code and to help if they can and even use their teammates code to help themselves. The coding this trimester(at least for me) was better. It took a while and was difficult but I think with more experience and learning more on the way, my coding abilities will improve.

## New Ideas
As stated in the improvements, an idea that can be beneficially for the team is sharing code with each other in order to help everyone. Helps by . . .
