## Reflection

Many of the questions that I was getting wrong were asking about what a given code segment would output or what to put in a code segment that would allow the code to output what it says it should. While I tried to simulate the code in my head, I was also trying to practice answering the questions in a reasonable amount of time so that I would be better at managing my time when I take the actual test. This resulted in me rushing through these types of problems and failing. I was unable to keep track of the points of value in the code segments in my head. I believe the only way I can fix this is to take more practice exams with these types of problems. I will also need to study more on the use of sequence of bits and other binary related questions. Along with that, I must also remember that programs do different things which means the time is takes to do it is different but is still considered resonable.

- An algorithm that accesses each element in the list twice(This can be used to check other values in a list with the index before or after it and do the same process for that index.)

- An algorithm that accesses each element in the list n times(This can be used to check other values in a list with all the other values in that list and still do the same process for those indexes.)

- An algorithm that accesses only the first few numbers of elements in the list, regardless of the size of the list(This can be used if only the first few elements are needed.)

Lastly, I need to understand more about boolean operations and which operators will result in true or false based on what true or false values are inputted.
