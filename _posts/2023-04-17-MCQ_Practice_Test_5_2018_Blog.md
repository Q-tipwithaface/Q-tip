## Reflection

Many topics on the practice test were topics that I have almost forgot and knew little about. However, I managed to successfully answer those questions by comparing it to other bits of infomation and by knowing what a computer needs and/or what options are not possible. I did work on this practice test with my group and their help was big, so I will need to study more on the areas where I needed extra help. Those topics included are the use of metadata, lossy vs lossless compression, and processes of encryption. Another part I will need to work on was time. It took a while for me to complete the test but there is strategies I can use that will let me finish fastest. I should read the question first in a porblem with a large set-up and look at the answers to immediately determine which areas are not possible without even knowing the set-up. I would then go back to read the rest of the problem to determine the right choose between the reminding answers and to confirm that the other options are still not possible.
