<td>Program Purpose and Function</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>I gave this part a 1 because the response showed and explained how the program functions and also describes the purpose without restating the function.</td>
<td>NA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data Abstraction</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>I gave this part a 0 because the second program code segments do not use the list displayed in the first code segment. This makes the list not assist in the program’s purpose.</td>
<td>NA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Managing Complexity</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>I gave this part a 0 because the list is irrelevant to the piece of code provided. The code does use the list RPS in other parts of the code but not in the code shown in 3b, making this a zero.</td>
<td>NA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>I gave this part a 0 because the purpose of the code segments shown are not mentioned in the response. The purpose being how this is helpful to the rest of the program.</td>
<td>NA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>I gave this part a 1 because the response tells the reader how the program runs and what allows it to work. Also clarifies use of sequencing, selection, and iterion.</td>
<td>NA</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Testing</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>I gave this part a 1 because the two different calls to through different code segments that result in the outputs being different and telling the reader what code segments it went through.</td>

<li>Explain and show how the input leads to an output</li>

<h2 id="Failed-to-meet-the-standards">Failed to meet the standards<a class="anchor-link" href="#Failed-to-meet-the-standards"> </a></h2><p>For these four examples, a submission is most likely to fail to meet the standard by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, code segments, or the entire program or by not explaining how a program functions. Defining a program's funciton is not the same as defining the program's purpose. There also must be an understanding of code so that they can be split up to fill in the part of the response that needs code. If you understand the code, them the code present in the response should earn you the points.</p>
