## Performance Task Scoring 1

| Category | My Scoring | College Board Scoring | My Comments | What I missed if scoring is different |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I gave this part a 1 because the student was very straightforward in their responses resulting in no places where the student would do something they were not allowed to do. The submission also meets all the requirements. | The written response doesnâ€™t go deep enough on what the purpose of the program is. It needed to be more specific about what information of a triangle is outputted. |
