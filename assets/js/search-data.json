What is a second way that you can message her? . | Her email is rchristopher@powayusd.com. A second way is by directly messaging her in Canvas by using the inbox. . What are the four possible units of study? . | The four possible units of study are: The Tragic Hero, THe Hero’s Journey and Hero Archetypes, Deserving Hero, and The Superhero Hero. . Identify one higher level thinking skill, one reading comprehension skill, and one writing skill from the syllabus that you would like to work on this trimester? Explain why. . | A higher level thinking skill I would want to work on is evaluation because it would allow me to find better evidence in a text.

A writing skill I want to work on is organization because I have a hard time having my thoughts flow well together in an organized way. . Your teacher uses the weighted grade system. Within this system, what are the two categories and how are they weighted?In the weighted grade system, summative work will count as 70% and formative work will count as 30% of my total course grade. . | Explain the bathroom pass and break policy. With the bathroom pass and break policy, a student must sign out at the front of the room to get a hall pass from the teacher. Passes should be used only when needed and students should get back to class as soon as possible. . | What do you need to do if you are absent from class? . | Students will need to check the Canvas calendar for assignments if they are absent from class. If a student knows they are going to be absent, they have to come in the morning of a test or quiz or come to the tutorial the day before to take the test/quiz. If a student misses a class when there’s a speaking assignment, they may have a chance to make it up but it’s not guaranteed and you could lose points. . Explain the late work policy in your own words. . | The late work policy for writing assignments means that you will lose 10 percent a day of total points, until they can be worth no more than 75%. Students have until the end of the unit to turn in late work and have a chance to get 50% credit if the work “meets standards.” If the standards are not met, the student will get a second chance to turn it in to meet the standards. . Explain the culture of inclusion and equity. . | The culture of inclusion and equity means that you should treat everyone the same and treat everyone the way you want to be treated: with kindness and respect. We should all accept each other for who we are and it doesn’t matter their race, gender identity, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation. . What is plagiarism? What steps can you take to avoid plagiarism? . | Plagiarism is when you use someone else’s work and claim it as your own for credit. Steps to take to avoid plagiarism would be to use quotation marks and give credit to the source/authors. Another way is to keep track of the resources or sites you use. .

Movie Title Hero’s Journey: state which stage &amp; explain it in movie Character Archetype: state archetype, state character’s name, and explain how he/she fits the archetype . Wizard of Oz | Crossing the First Threshold- Dorothy lands in Oz and kills the Wicked Witch of the West with her house. She crosses from the ordinary world of Kansas to the magical land of Oz. | Hero = Dorothy, Dorothy longs for a different exciting life and is dissatisfied with her country girl life. On her quest to return home she makes sacrifices for her friends, experiences personal growth and gains wisdom from her challenges. She learns to appreciate and value her family and her ordinary life. | . The Maze Runner | Crossing the First Threshold- Thomas enters the maze with Minho and Alby right when it closes and is stuck there for the night. He crosses from the ordinary world of the glade into the maze | Hero = Thomas, Thomas looks for a way out of the glade through the deadly maze and brings everyone out of the deadly maze and into the rest of the world. He sacrifices himself to find ways out and to save people. | . Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone | Crossing the First Threshold - Harry crosses the first threshold into the wizarding world when he first enters Diagon Alley. This is where he first experiences meeting wizards, buying his first wand, and going to Gringotts Bank. | Hero = Harry Potter, the predominant persona in the series, represents the “hero” archetype. Harry in the sequence is the loved, successful, and morally straight personality that usually saves the day. He is an illustration of all the fine characteristics in our society: courage, intelligence, athleticism, and loyalty. | . Spy Kids | Crossing the fist threshold: Carmen and Juni’s house get attacked and they escape in a submarine to a safe house. | Heroes = Carmen and Junie are two heroes that are unhappy with their life.

Throughout the movie, Frank also gives useful information about the monsters(the enemies) and helps them heavily in some of the trails. | . Hero’s Journey/Character Archetype Paragraph Date: 12/2/2021 Assign #6 . Writing a Two Chunk: Use this handout (it will ensure that you have all of the parts) . Support Thesis (aka Topic Sentence)– i.e. In the movie __, the character __ becomes a hero when __ (one of the stages). . In the movie Wreck it Ralph, the character Ralph displays the archetype hero when he faces obstacles that change and grow him as a person. Initially, Ralph is lonely, isolated, and misunderstood. He wants to be accepted and not seen as the bad guy anymore in his video game. He jumps into another video game to prove to everyone that he could be a hero by winning the prized medal. However, he ends up being transported to Sugar Rush Land where he meets Penelope. This is significant because Penelope plays a big part of Ralph’s evolution. She brings out traits and emotions in him that he never knew he had, such as: playfulness, protectiveness, love, and trustworthiness. She makes him realize that it’s better to have a true friend than a trophy. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #1 (you may paraphrase or quote the movie): . During the climax of the movie, Ralph sends himself and hundreds of mentos into a volcano of hot coke knowing that it would kill him but would also end up killing the Cy-bugs that were terrorizing Sugar Rush. . . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . This part of the movie is important because it proves that Ralph is the hero. In a movie that uses the hero’s journey, the definition of a hero is the character that needs to overcome an obstacle that ends up changing the character. In the beginning of the story, Ralph was selfish because he only wanted a medal so that he could get the approval from his co-workers. However, later on, he realized that having true friends is better than approval and that it is better to actually be a better person. This heroic act of sacrificing himself for the greater good displays the role of hero. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #2: . Another example of when Ralph represents actions of a hero is when he learned that Penelope’s racing could cause her to lose her life. In order for this to not happen, Ralph decided that the best course of action was to destroy her racing car. . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . While this seems like a cruel act to do, he displays archetype hero traits of protection and love. Heroes often are faced with making hard decisions that may hurt people, but they do it with good intentions. Ralph destroyed Penelope’s car because he didn’t want to lose his only friend and would rather risk their friendship than her life. This is a selfless act often seen by archetypal heroes. . Concluding Sentence . In conclusion, Ralph is an archetypal hero in Wreck it Ralph because he evolves from being a self-centered lonely character to one that would sacrifice everything he values for the greater good. . Do Heroes Make us Smarter Date: 12/7/2021 Assignment#: 7 Close reading practice . Article Notes . Do Heroes Make Us Smarter? . Heroes give us direction, wisdom, and emotional intelligence. . By Scott T. Allison, Ph.D., Psychology Today, Apr 13, 2014 . When legendary South African President Nelson Mandela passed away in 2013, the world responded with heartache mixed with reverence. President Barack Obama observed that Mandela “no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages.” With this statement, Obama illustrated what we have always done to our greatest heroes—we forge them in eternity. . Why do we idolize great heroic leaders? Obviously, heroes provide us with hope and inspiration. But my research on heroes reveals a surprising finding—they make us smarter, too. Heroes improve our intelligence about the world and teach us lessons about the trajectory of our own lives. Our research has uncovered four ways that heroes impart wisdom to us. . 1. Heroes teach us how to respond in crisis situations . In 2007, Wesley Autrey, a construction worker living in Harlem, received international acclaim when he rescued a complete stranger from an oncoming New York subway train. Autrey witnessed the man fall on the subway tracks just as a train was approaching. Realizing he had no time to move the man from the tracks, Autrey made the remarkable decision to lie down on top of him in-between the rails as the train passed over them both. Only one-half inch separated Autrey from severe injury or death. . After performing this heroic act, Autrey received hundreds of letters from people thanking him for showing them how to live their lives and how to respond in emergency situations. Autrey and other selfless heroes like him teach us what to do, and the right thing to do, in challenging situations. Heroes like Autrey provide a script for heroic action to a world hungry for such a script. . 2. Hero stories illuminate paradoxical life truths . Spiritual guru Richard Rohr argues that hero stories are saturated with complex life truths that are nearly impossible for humans to grasp unless they are illustrated inside a good hero story. Many of these truths are paradoxical secrets of human growth and development. For example, in a typical hero story, the hero cannot grow as a person until after he or she has experienced a significant falling or failing. “Where you stumble,” wrote comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, “there lies your treasure.” Other paradoxical truths in hero stories include the wisdom that (a) we must leave home to find home; (b) we must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; (c) we must surrender to win; and (d) we must give up something important to gain something important. . 3. Heroes teach us that their journey is the human journey . Joseph Campbell believed that the Hero’s Journey parallels human developmental stages. All young adults are driven out of their safe, familiar worlds and into the fearful real world. Psychologist Eric Erikson’s stages of human lifespan development suggest a hero trajectory during our lives, with young adults driven to establish competencies and carve out an identity for themselves. . Older adults reach a stage of generativity, which Erikson defines as people’s desire to create things that will outlast them and to give back to the society that has given them so much. Hero stories teach us that we are all developmentally equipped to pursue a lifelong hero-like journey. . 4. Heroes help us develop emotional intelligence . Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim believed that children’s fairy tales are useful in helping people, especially children, understand emotional experience. The heroes of these fairy tales are usually subjected to dark, foreboding experiences, such as encounters with witches, evil spells, abandonment, neglect, abuse, and death. Listeners to these tales develop strategies for resolving their fears and distress. . Bettelheim believed that even the most distressing fairy tales, such as those by the Brothers Grimm, add clarity to confusing emotions and give people a greater sense of life’s meaning and purpose. The darkness of fairy tales allows children to grow emotionally, thus developing their emotional intelligence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood. . Conclusion . Heroes give us far more than inspiration—they are our greatest teachers. Heroes show us the secrets to unlocking our fullest potential as human beings. They do so by role-modeling virtue, by clarifying complex and paradoxical life truths, by equipping us with emotional intelligence, and by revealing how their journey can be our journey, too. No wonder Obama said that Nelson Mandela “belongs to the ages.” The wisdom we get from our heroes has a timeless quality that helps us thrive as human beings. . | Purpose: To have an historic detail that supports their argument and can be relatable. .

Vera Atkins, 92, Spymaster for British, Dies . By Douglas Martin published in the New York Times, June 27, 2000 . Article Annotations . Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92. . Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for &#39;&#39;M.&#39;&#39; . But Ms. Atkins&#39;s steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny&#39;s lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins&#39;s heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France. . After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money. . &#39;&#39;I could not just abandon their memory,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.&#39;&#39; . She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. &#39;&#39;I was probably the only person who could do this,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.&#39;&#39; . The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess&#39;s reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz. . &#39;&#39;Oh no,&#39;&#39; he said, as if offended. &#39;&#39;It was 2,345,000.&#39;&#39; . Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother&#39;s last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later. . At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up &#39;&#39;to set Europe ablaze&#39;&#39; through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, &#39;&#39;It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.&#39;&#39; . Hitler said, &#39;&#39;When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.&#39;&#39; . Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster&#39;s assistant, Ms. Atkins. . The spymasters headed the unit&#39;s F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it. . The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens. . The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester. . They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds. . It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets. . At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service. . Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a &#39;&#39;sledgehammer,&#39;&#39; pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive. . One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, &#39;&#39;Road to Resistance,&#39;&#39;( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. &#39;&#39;Oh, the bloody English!&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.&#39;&#39; . Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its title from her first name. . Ms. Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987. . She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see France. . Editors&#39; Note: July 14, 2000, Friday An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times&#39;s research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications. Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins&#39;s background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins&#39;s retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased. . Editors’ Note: July 14, 2000 .

Within thy help and holy physic lies: . I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, . My intercession likewise steads my foe. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; . Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. . ROMEO . Then plainly know my heart&#39;s dear love is set . On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: . As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; . And all combined, save what thou must combine . By holy marriage: when and where and how . We met, we woo&#39;d and made exchange of vow, . I&#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, . That thou consent to marry us to-day. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! . Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, . So soon forsaken? young men&#39;s love then lies . Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. . Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine . Hath wash&#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! . How much salt water thrown away in waste, . To season love, that of it doth not taste! . The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, . Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; . Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit . Of an old tear that is not wash&#39;d off yet: . If e&#39;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, . Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: .

Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. . | Romeo states that he was with his enemy and was hurt and now needs help from a holy man in order to heal.

Intercession: praying for another person. . Friar states that young men’s love lies in his eyes, not his heart.

Friar thinks Romeo is being irrational by letting go of Rosaline after trying to get her to love him for so long. He thinks Romeo is being weak to allow himself to fall in love with another woman so quickly.

This type of conflict is inner conflict because it is Romeo vs his own passion for Juliet. I think Romeo is right to let Rosaline go because their relationship would never have worked out because it lacked true love. . Highlight the Friar’s warning in his final line. How is his warning similar to Juliet’s in Act 2.2 “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;/ Too like the lightning which doth cease to be” (Act 2.2 lines 129-130) . | Both statements are warnings to Romeo that imply that if their relationship moves too fast and without careful planning, it will start to crumble.

After Romeo hears the false news that Juliet is dead, he lies next to her sleeping body, preparing to kill himself for her: . 88   How oft when men are at the point of death  .  89   Have they been merry! which their keepers call   90   A lightning before death: O, how may I   91   Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!   92   Death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath,   93   Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: .  94   Thou art not conquer&#39;d; beauty&#39;s ensign yet   95   Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,  .  96   And death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there.  .  97   Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?   98   O, what more favor can I do to thee,  .  99   Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain  . 100   To sunder his that was thine enemy?  101   Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,  102   Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe  103   That unsubstantial death is amorous,  104   And that the lean abhorred monster keeps  105   Thee here in dark to be his paramour?  . 106   For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;  107   And never from this palace of dim night  108   Depart again. Here, here will I remain  109   With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here  110   Will I set up my everlasting rest,  111   And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars  112   From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!  113   Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you  114   The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss  . 115   A dateless bargain to engrossing death!             [Kisses Juliet, then speaks to the container of poison.]  . 116   Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!  117   Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on  . 118   The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!  119   Here&#39;s to my love!             [Drinks.]  119                                           O true apothecary!  120   Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.  . | Romeo is describing that Juliet is now dead but that death had not taken her beauty.

Romeo calls the poison a guide because he believes the poison will lead him to the afterlife where he could find Juliet. . | There are more words about death than the ones about love because this scene is Romeo talking about how death took Juliet and is now wanting death to take him as well. Him referring to death a lot makes it sound like he is calling for death and is begging for death to take him to Juiliet. . | | .

Romeo saying this is him saying that he is breaking free from his fate by killing himself. After hearing the false news about Juliet’s death and believing in it, Romeo says “Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars! (5,1,2830)” . Highlight lines 117-118. Compare the metaphor in these lines to Act 2.2.82-83 “I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far/ As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,/ I should adventure for such merchandise” In each line, the “pilot” (captain of a ship) is different. Explain the difference. . | The difference between the pilot in this scene and the pilot in Act 2.2.82-83 is that the pilot from act 2 is a new pilot that is ready for adventure. In this scene however, the pilot is now experienced and is now sick of his adventures. The pilot being Romeo, Romeo is sick of all the misery that is in his life and just wants to die to be with Juliet, his one true love. . Explain the effect of having Romeo directly talk to “death” in this monologue. . | Romeo directly talking to death affects the way the audience sees him. Romeo, who is so excited to take on the world in the first part of the play is now begging death to take him to Juliet. This shows that Juliet is now Romeo’s world and that Romeo would do anything to get back to it. . Close Reading and Writing Practice Act 3.5.1-16 Date: 2/10/2022 Assignment: 23 .

(5) . Romeo: It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night&#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. (10) I must be gone and live, or stay and die. . Juliet: Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: It is some meteor that the sun exhales, To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua: (15) Therefore stay yet; thou need&#39;st not to be gone. . | Jocund: lighthearted and cheerful. .

Romeo and Juliet has led us astray: Romantic love, love at first sight – it’s great theater but disastrous dating advice. . February 14, 2010 | By Andrew Trees | . “Romeo and Juliet has Led us Astray” Notes, Annotations, Answers to questions . What if Shakespeare had it wrong about love in Romeo and Juliet? In fact, what if all of us have it wrong and our ideals of love and romance are hopelessly awry? Although we are supposed to be celebrating our love for that special someone on Valentine&#39;s Day, perhaps the time has come to reconsider the concept of romantic love, at least as it has been conceived in Western societies. . As we busily track down red roses, the best chocolates and the finest champagnes, we need to ask whether, in the pursuit of the perfect romance, we haven&#39;t declared war on true love. Cupid&#39;s arrow does strike often, but with the U.S. divorce rate near 50%, one has to wonder whether the wound is particularly deep or long-lasting. (Love) . As I found when researching my book on the science of human attraction, our typical romantic beliefs are quite often wrong. For instance, even couples who are blissfully happy together can&#39;t count on a happy ending. The PAIR project, a long-term academic study of couples, found that those most in love when they marry are also the most likely to get divorced. . And the chemical attraction that many people rely on to choose a partner has been found to fade &quot;to neutrality&quot; in two to three years. That&#39;s right, neutrality, which might work well for Switzerland but is deadly for a marriage. . Perhaps most damning of all, I discovered that wife murderers tend to be strong subscribers to the romantic ideal. Take that, Romeo and Juliet. . Love and romance did not always rule the roost. As recently as the 1930s, American men ranked mutual attraction as only the fourth most important quality for a relationship, while women had it even lower, placing it fifth (in a 1956 survey, women dropped it all the way to sixth). But in recent decades, love has climbed to No. 1, accompanied by a rise in the importance of looks, which suggests that our romance with romance is long on style and short on substance. . I hate to sound unromantic on this day of all days, but perhaps it&#39;s time to place less emphasis on romantic attraction as the key to finding a partner. What can shoulder some of the load? I would suggest that we rely a little more on what science has discovered about human attraction. . For instance, some researchers can now predict whether a couple will stay together with far more accuracy than the couple themselves. And it has less to do with the things we might think, such as fighting, and far more to do with the things we take for granted, such as asking your spouse about his or her day. . That doesn&#39;t mean we need to jettison every aspect of chemical attraction. Several studies have found that for women, a man&#39;s body odor is a helpful guide to finding a good genetic match (but only if the woman is not taking an oral contraceptive, which reverses her usual smell preferences). Body odor doesn&#39;t sound very romantic, but perhaps the better question to ask is: How did our narrow ideal of romantic love come to hold such complete sway in the first place? . Imagine a dating world turned on its head, in which people were not given the freedom to opt into or out of a relationship -- such as a culture that practices arranged marriages. What researchers have found will be shocking to Westerners weaned on the idea of romantic love. . According to a 1982 study by two Indian researchers, the level of self-reported love in arranged marriages increased over time until they surpassed the level of self-reported love in marriages that were freely chosen. Incredible as it sounds, people with a very limited say in choosing their own spouses eventually became happier with their relationships than people with the freedom to choose anyone they wanted. . Although we almost always read Romeo and Juliet as the quintessential story of love at first sight, Shakespeare actually offered his own sly critique of romantic love at the beginning of the play. Romeo is pining away for love -- but not for Juliet. There is another fair damsel who has rejected Romeo&#39;s advances, and he declares himself inconsolable. He disdains finding someone else and tells Benvolio, &quot;Thou canst not teach me to forget&quot; -- which is, of course, precisely what happens a few scenes later when Romeo meets Juliet and realizes that he was completely wrong before and only now has discovered true love. . We never remember that part of the story, though, because if we think of Romeo and Juliet from that perspective, the whole play starts to skew in ways that contradict our usual romantic notions. . Perhaps the time has come for us to take a skeptical view of romance, particularly the over-the-top variety peddled so effectively on Valentine&#39;s Day. We should throw off the shackles of our reigning romantic orthodoxy and realize that Romeo and Juliet and its many cultural offspring have led us astray. Shakespeare&#39;s story may be transcendent entertainment, but it is disastrous dating advice. .

In the video, I learned that people in the future could look at today’s superheroes and think of them as our culture. This also made me wonder if we are looking at past cultures in the same way that future cultures might be looking at us. It made me wonder if people hundreds or even thousands of years ago were as attached to their gods, legends, or heros as people of today are to theirs. Heros can show the value of a culture because heroes are looked at as an ideal or the best a person can be. People who look up to a hero also want to be as good as them or at least the best they themself can be. This is the reason heroes were made and why many people inbrance their ideas, heroes bring out the best part of a person. A person showing the best part of themself could become a real life hero and can make the world better and safer. . Journal #2 Date: 1/4/2022 . Courage is possibly the most common trait for a hero. Courage is going after something and knowing that the journey to it will be dangerous and that you might end up failing. The heroic part about courage is that the hero knows that what they are doing is dangerous but chooses to continue on the journey because they are doing it for the greater good. A person that is courageous is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. He chose to go into the death star to save princess Leia knowing he and his group were outnumbered and were mostly likely going to be overpowered. He even went back to help the rebels blow up the death star, still being outnumbered and overpowered. Luke did this because it was for the greater good and was worth the risk. Everyday people teach us that we want someone that has greater traits such as courage to be a leader and a face for our community. . Journal #3 Date:1/26/2022 . Act 2.2-2.3 Writing Practice .

If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.” – Ernest Hemingway . What Ernest is saying is that when someone loses their love, they become lonely. Love will never have a happy ending because no one can escape death and the lovers’ separation would lead to depression for the longer lasting lover and a tragic ending. This happened when Juliet kills herself after seeing Romeo dead(3.5.3122-3137). Juliet’s end is a tragic one because of the loss causing her to become depressed. .

What are some other names for procedures?: . Processes or Functions. . Why are procedures effective?: . Procedures are effective because they have the ability to change the result of a piece of code without actually changing the calls to the program. This is effective because it is easier than going into a function and changing different variables and sub functions and risk causes errors. . Additional Notes! . Procedure can or can no return a value. Values include numbers and booleans. Procedure works similarly to a function. Defining the procedure calls it along with setting its parameters. Parameter is the value(s) that would be used in the procedure to determine the output. Procedures have the ability to change the result without changing the calls to the program. . In java, you call a prodecure by defining its function. Defining the function allows values to change the parameters, resulting in a new outcome. Those new values are normally inputed by the coder in the code, not in a input, but it can be. . Procedural Abstraction provides a name for a process that makes it so a procedure can be used knowing what it does. Kind of like defining a function. This allows the code to use the procedure in different situations. . Modularity is used to help identiy any sort of issues that arise in the code.

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

The backend is normally used for the running of different tasks, functions, programs, and even other servers. This allows a program to run its parts and to be usable. The Frontend is normally used just for the user/users to have access to the program. Its job is to display it to the user and do it by having connections with the backend. | . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;.

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a Dictionary.&gt; The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. | . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is 0(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) . {1, 2, 3} . What do you notice in the output? . I noticed that the output is printing only one of each value in the list my_set. It removes the duplicates in a list. . Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? . I think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables because both result in outputing only unique values in order to be hashable and they remove all the duplicate values. . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

Provide answers and thoughts on theoritical question form college board Video in section 4.3. They start at about the 9 minute mark. . Example 1 . Answer: 50 seconds. Because the two processors are the same, they take the same amount of time to process all the processes. Therefore, one processor can run process y and process z for a total of 40 seconds and the other processor can run process x for a total of 50 seconds. Since the processes run at the same time, the total time to complete all the processes is 50 seconds. . Example 2 . Answer: 25 seconds. On a single processor, the total time to execute process a and process b is 70 seconds. For parallel processing, the total time is 45 seconds. 70 seconds minus 45 seconds is 25 seconds. . Example 3 . Answer: The first processor should process both process a and b while the second processor processes both process c and d. The first processor would take 50 seconds to execute and the second processor will also take 50 seconds. This ends up being the shortest amount of time because adding the longest time and the shortest time makes it so that the longest option is the shortest compared to other combinations. .

            "content": "Recap . As of now, my create performance task is a mini game that is based on the game fruit ninja. A user needs to click on food items that flash on their screen in order to earn points. Right now, there is no where a user can input their own data into the game. However, I plan to make users input data in the form of a leaderboard. . Leaderboard . The leaderboard will allow users the ability to save their score by placing it in the global leaderboard. The ability to save a user&#39;s score will run if that user&#39;s score is in the top scores of the entire existence of the game. The top scores will show the highest 10 scores but that number might change. In addition to the score, the object will also include the name of the user and the date the score was saved. The name inputted by the user will be a unique name. Even if a user gets a top score, they can choose not to save it and it will not be present in the leaderboard. This leaderboard is almost like the leaderboards used in classic arcade games like Galactic, Pac-Man, and more! . . Visual Appeal . As well as having no leaderboard, the game has little elements of decoration that makes the game feel more incomplete. This problem can be solved by having the backgroud a becoming different theme, a different color, or even having the background be an image. Another way to make the game more visually appealing would be to add new food items for the users to click on. These options will help add more life to the game and make the game more polished. Making the game visually appealing will be second to adding a leaderboard because the leaderboard is a more needed feature compared to making the game look pretty. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . Programmers should care about space and time complexity keeping thoses ideas in mind can affect how the program will end up. A programmer will most likely want to create a program using a certain amount of space and how long the process it does takes. This is a factor on what or who can use this program and to determine if it is opteratable. . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk.

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) # print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) # print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n).

Hacks . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | . Time and space complexity is important when choosing an algorithm because it measures which algorithm will be the most efficient for running a task. . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | . You shouldn&#39;t always use a constant time algorithm because an element might have more elements to it. If that is the case, it is better to use the exponential time because even through it might take longer, the process will result in an more organized output of data. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . I noticed that time complexity is more likely to be changed than space complexity. This is because most of the time, the data will not be changed but how it is used is changed more often. I also noticed that the time complexity of something is determined by how it repeats a process for each piece of data. If the loops are outside each other, time is addition. If a loop is inside another loop, it is multiplication. If a loop is inside another loop and divides the amount of data, it is logarithm. If a loop is inside another loop and multiplies the amount of data, it is exponential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Practice Problems for Time and Space Complexity . Question 1 . a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): #O(N) a = a + random() #O(1) #O(N) and O(M) are independent for i in range(M): #O(M) b= b + random() #O(1) #time: O(N+M) #space: O(1) . Question 2 . a = 0; for i in range(N): #O(N) for j in reversed(range(i,N)): #O(N) a = a + i + j; #O(N) is dependent of O(N) #time: O(N * N) . Question 3 . k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): #O(N) for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): #log(N) k = k + n / 2; #time: O(n * log(n)) . Question 4 . # X will always be a better choice for large inputs becuase X normally takes up less time than Y. . Question 5 . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): #&lt;- a += i #- O(log N) i //= 2 #&lt;-- #time: O(log N) . Question 6 . # Both Time and Memory because they are what is used to measure a program&#39;s efficiency. . Question 7 . # Time complexity is measured the number of primitive operations ran by the program based on a the given size of the input. . Question 8 . for i in range(n): #O(log(N)) i=i*k #O(log(N)) is based on the value of k because it goes back into i #time: O(log(k)(n)) . Question 9 . value = 0; for i in range(n): # O(N) for j in range(i): # O(N) value=value+1 # -1 #time: n(n-1) . Question 10 . # This is false because Algorithm A might work faster than algoritm B when running a different Big O notations. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

Both option (A) and option (C) both have spreadsheets II and the spreadsheets I and III are similar in that they both have students’ grade point average. However, spreadsheet III is not the correct sheet because it only contains the names of the people who have a grade point average above 3.5 but not the actual grade point average values.

The hacked part is used to tell the user that their password was not good enough and would result in them easily getting hacked by an online attacker. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? | . Try / Except: Try/expect first tries to do something in the try section but if that section of code results in an error, the expect section is ran. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . The code repeated on the dot are some of the last two lines, cursor.close() and conn.close().

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | . DELETE is a dangerous operation because it can permanently remove data that could have been useful and/or needed. . In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . &quot;f&quot; is used to format the following in the print statement into a string. {uid} is used to display the string of the uid that was inserted. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | . The menu repeats to constantly show the programmer that all the operations are running. If they are not, the code with stop running and will tell the user to run all the functions written before it. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . This menu can be formated to make it work as a list because it will still use if,elif,else statements to determine what to make of the characters in the list. . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

Some of the big ideas and vocab that you observe, talk about it with a partner ... . &quot;Data compression is the reduction of the number of bits needed to represent data&quot; | &quot;Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space.&quot; | &quot;lossy data can reduce data but the original data is not recovered&quot; | &quot;lossless data lets you restore and recover&quot; | . The Image Lab Project contains a plethora of College Board Unit 2 data concepts. Working with Images provides many opportunities for compression and analyzing size. . Image Files and Size . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . - File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab: File type determines what the result of the image can come out to be. The file type must be able to operate with whatever code it is used in.&lt;/p&gt; - Size, height and width, number of pixels: The size and the number of pixels used results in the image taking up more storage. The larger the image, the more storage it will need to use.&lt;/p&gt; - Visual perception: Some types of images can have different attributes that change the way that the image might be displayed in.&lt;/p&gt; - lossy compression: Lossy compression results in a smaller file meaning less storage space. However, lossy compression does this by removing part of the data in an image resulting in it becoming of less quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Displaying images in Python Jupyter notebook . Python Libraries and Concepts used for Jupyter and Files/Directories . IPython . Support visualization of data in Jupyter notebooks. Visualization is specific to View, for the web visualization needs to be converted to HTML. . pathlib . File paths are different on Windows versus Mac and Linux. This can cause problems in a project as you work and deploy on different Operating Systems (OS&#39;s), pathlib is a solution to this problem. . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? | . - cd - dir&lt;/p&gt; - mkdir&lt;/p&gt; - del&lt;/p&gt; - ren&lt;/p&gt; - copy&lt;/p&gt; - move&lt;/p&gt; - edit&lt;/p&gt; What are the commands you use in Windows terminal to access files? | . The commands listed over are the ones used in windows terminal. I use a windows computer for running my terminal.&lt;/p&gt; What are some of the major differences? | . There are no major differences because they are the same system. My computer is ran by windows and so is the terminal inside of it.&lt;/p&gt; Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? | . The path used in code when working with images is a big deal because the path is used to pull the data about the image. If the incorrect path is used, the algorithm will not be able to find the data for an image, resulting in the code breaking due to missing data.&lt;/p&gt; How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? | . Meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics because both refer to the use and management of data. The topics in Unit 5 talk about the uses of data and how is itself can be used. Meta data adds an extra layer to that because meta data is data about data. This makes it fall under the Topics in Unit 5 and inplies that the uses of data are the same for the uses of meta data.&lt;/p&gt; Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? | . IPython is a system that makes the use of Pandas and Images easiler. In Jupyter Notebook, it provides easy access to changing data, easy access to display data and images in the notebook, easy documentation inside code cells, and displaying images and data inside and during the creation of the notebook. To summarize, IPython makes using Jupyter Notebooks and the Pandas and images inside of it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Run this as standalone tester to see sample data printed in Jupyter terminal if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # print parameter supplied image green_square = image_data(images=[{&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}]) image_display(green_square) # display default images from image_data() default_images = image_data() image_display(default_images) . Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Base64 is similar to Binary and Hexadecimal because they all use a base to the power of an interger to display numbers. Base64 is different to Binary and Hexadecimal because Base64 has a base of 64.&lt;/p&gt; Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . Luc --&gt; TA0KdQ0KYw==&lt;/p&gt; numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . When loading new tabs or functions on websites, when downloading files, and when uploading files.&lt;/p&gt; From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . I lost time and/or lost interest in whatever I was doing.&lt;/p&gt; How do these effects apply to images? | . I could also loss the time to look at images or lost interest in the image if it is not loading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? | . Yes, the code is going through diffenent steps before it results in the images turning grey.&lt;/p&gt; Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? | . The algorithm pulls the images and scales the data. It then convert is to base64 in order for the program to change each pixel to its grey style. Finally, it displays the output, scaled and scaled/grey.&lt;/p&gt; Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? | . Each image is scaled to a width of 320 with its height being scaled by the same ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? | . Scaling an image down is a type of compression because it is removing the amount of pixels in an image. It is also lossy compression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; from IPython.display import HTML, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import Image as pilImage # as pilImage is used to avoid conflicts from io import BytesIO import base64 import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Green Square&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;green-square-16.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Clouds Impression&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;clouds-impression.png&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Peter Carolin&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Lassen Volcano&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;lassen-volcano.jpg&quot;}, {&#39;source&#39;: &quot;Internet&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Smile face&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;smileface.jpg&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Jupyter Notebook Visualization of Images if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Use numpy to concatenate two arrays images = image_data() # Display meta data, scaled view, and grey scale for each image for image in images: image_management(image) print(&quot;- meta data --&quot;) print(image[&#39;label&#39;]) print(image[&#39;source&#39;]) print(image[&#39;format&#39;]) print(image[&#39;mode&#39;]) print(&quot;Original size: &quot;, image[&#39;size&#39;]) print(&quot;Scaled size: &quot;, image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;]) print(&quot;-- original image --&quot;) display(HTML(image[&#39;html&#39;])) print(&quot; grey image -&quot;) image_management_add_html_grey(image) display(HTML(image[&#39;html_grey&#39;])) print() . - meta data -- Green Square Internet PNG RGBA Original size: (16, 16) Scaled size: (320, 320) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Clouds Impression Peter Carolin PNG RGBA Original size: (320, 234) Scaled size: (320, 234) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Lassen Volcano Peter Carolin JPEG RGB Original size: (2792, 2094) Scaled size: (320, 240) -- original image -- . grey image - . - meta data -- Smile face Internet JPEG RGB Original size: (223, 226) Scaled size: (320, 324) -- original image -- . grey image - . . Data Structures and OOP . Most data structures classes require Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Since this class is lined up with a College Course, OOP will be talked about often. Functionality in remainder of this Blog is the same as the prior implementation. Highlight some of the key difference you see between imperative and oop styles. . Read imperative and object-oriented programming on Wikipedia | Consider how data is organized in two examples, in relations to procedures | Look at Parameters in Imperative and Self in OOP | . Additionally, review all the imports in these three demos.

Overall, for College Board, you will need a part of functionally code with a purpose and your skills to go over it to show your understanding. . For my Create Performance Task, I will be using the part of the code where random food is put in a random place on the screen. I will be creating that part of the code so I will also be the one talking about it for College Board. Random foods will come from a list of foods and the screen will be split into a grid in order for there to be a coordinate plane. The code will use random numbers to come up with a coordinate. This portion will most likely be done in the frontend as this is the part where the users will interact with the most. . The plan for this assignment is to code a game that serves a greater purpose than just to cure boredom. The group&#39;s plan is to work individually on their parts of the program but to use class time to go over current progress and to ask questions. The plan is to do some research and add what we will learn to our code. In code, lists will be used to store different types of infomation that will shape what the code will result in. Since the coding will be done individually most of the time, all team members will have their our directory in order to prevent merge conflicts and will put work together during meetings. . The video will open with the user creating an account to login and then go start playing the game. The video will show how the output of the game is changed by showing runs with different inputs. The video will also show how the program will function and how its variables start to change based on its other variables and functions. .",

            "content": "Test Results . . Questions I missed . Question 2 . . I chose (B) but the correct answer was (A). The Internet Protocol Address of a user’s computer is meant to be public as it allows for other computers to talk and connect with each other. A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser is the greatest potential for compromising a user’s privacy because connecting to websites are not as secure as other places on the internet making it easy for attackers to steal personal data from them. . Question 6 . . I chose (B) but the correct answer was (C). A list of common keywords makes answering a person’s problem a lot easier and can help the program identify a question it does not recognize. It is least likely to have a list of computers and the corresponding IP addresses because that infomation doesn’t help answer a customer’s problem. It sends the customer to a place that can help but it is not used to direct the problem and assist in forming a better answer. . Question 8 . . I chose (C) but the correct answer was (A). Digital certificates are used to verify ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communication. They are just pieces of infomation that makes sure that encryted keys are in the right hands. Digital certificates are not able to confirm that a connection to a website is a fault tolerant because it’s just pieces of infomation. This makes the answer I only. . Question 22 . . I chose (D) but the correct answer was (A). When working on this problem, I misread the code segment and thought that the last if statement was inside of the first if statement. This made me think that the code segment would result in the robot turning itself in a loop forever and would never reach the grey square. However, the last if statement is not apart of the other if statements, making the code segment lead to the grey square for only Grid I. . Question 41 . . I chose (A) but the correct answer was (B). The code segment is already in decimal form but that wouldn’t even mattter because the list has to be sorted by the gentic code values. Without a sorted list, binary search wouldn’t work because the search algorithm pin points where a value is based on other values in a list and if the values are not sorted, the algorithm would be lost. . Question 49 . . I chose (A) but the correct answer was (B). The model can be modified just like how code can be modified. However, a simulation is limited by the model that it uses. A model might not be able to simulation certain parts that may be needed to form accurate predictions. However, models are easier to use for this type of simulation. It ends up coming down to how accurate does the data need to be. . Question 50 . . I chose (B) and (C) but the correct answers were (A) and (D). Algorithm B and C are incorrect because the number of steps needed as the size of the list increases gets very big because the slope it trying to multiply and raise the power of steps at the same time. This causes a dramatic increase of steps. However, Algorithm A will always have only 10 steps as the list size increases and Algorithm D is only raising the power to its slope and not doing both multiplying and raising the power. This results in less steps meaning that algorithms A and D will run in a reasonable amount of time. .",

The input A and input B are both connected to eachother by an or statement. This means only one of the inputs needed to be true in order for the whole statement to be set to true. Since input A was already true, it didn&#39;t matter what input B was because the or statement only needs one true statement. The and statement now has two trues which results in the output being true. . Question 41 . I chose (A) and (C) but the correct answers were (A) and (D). [RANDOM (1, 5) = 1] works because there is a total of FIVE numbers and ONE of those numbers activates the part of the code that would hold 20% of the voters. 1 out of 5 times 100% is 20%. [RANDOM (1, 10) = 2] doesn&#39;t work because there is a total of TEN numbers and only ONE of those numbers activates the part of the code that should have helded 20% of the voters. However, it doesn&#39;t hold 20% of the voters but instead it is holds 10% because 1 out of 10 times 100% is only 10%. [RANDOM (1, 10) &lt;= 2] works because there is a total of TEN numbers and TWO of those numbers activates the part of the code that would hold 20% of the voters. The two numbers are 1 and 2. 2 out of 10 times 100% is 20% making this code segment one of the correct ones. During the test, I failed to see what the _ purpose was in the code segments and thought they represented the amount of numbers that activate the part of the code holding 20% of the voters. They were actual just representing the value or values maening &quot;=&quot; it used for one value while &quot;&lt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;&quot; can hold one or more values. . Question 45 . I chose (A) but the correct answer was (C). I chose (A) thinking that a heuristic approach was solving a problem in a resonable amount of time and come up with an approxiamte solution. However, an heuristic approach it actual when a problem can&#39;t be solved in a reasonable amount of time and people are forced to find an approximate solution. Basically, the answer you come up with when you can&#39;t solve something or don&#39;t have the time to solve it. It is like an educated guess. .",

If there is a new type of food, the Insert New Food Item section allows a user to insert a new food item to go into the Food Item section. . About the View . The View is made up of markdown text as well as markdown tables that have buttons that will cause an action when clicked upon. The current data in the Food Items section is used as an example to show how data will be presented. . Problems and Challenges . I was having trouble trying to change the format and the colors of the view and was unable to. This is only the view portion of the project but I was trying to create a function to move the data from the insert New Food Item to Food Items but was unable to. I think my problem was that I couldn&#39;t find the right coding languages to use and how to use the languages correctly with other languages. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Decision Problem: A problem that has a yes or no answer. | Organization Problem: A problem with the goal of finding the best solution. | . | Instance: A problem with a certain input. | Efficiency: Amount of effort needed to solve a problem. In coding, the effort is known as computing. Polynomial Efficiency (Good): Work takes a proportional amount more time. | Exponential Efficiency (Bad): Work takes an exponential amount more time. | . | Heuristic Approach: When the current solution is inefficive, search for a more efficient optimal solution. | Decidable Problem: A decision problem with one clear and correct solution. | Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution or multiple solutions that many not be correct. | . Notes . Efficiency in computer science is how fast a computer can run a process and/or program. | Unnecessary blocks of code will decrease the efficiency of the code. With less functions, the efficiency is higher and the process and/or program takes up less time to run. | The difference in exponential efficiency and polynomial efficiency is huge.

            "content": "Important Vocab! . Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that can have parameters and returning values. . Parameters: Inputs values of a procedure that limites it and allows certain values. . Arguments: Values of the parameters that are in motion when the procedure is called apond. . Modularity: The process of separating a function into its own pieces, each of them containing all the parts needed to execute a single part of the functionality. . Procedural Abstraction: An abstraction that provides a name for a process that makes it so a procedure can be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it. . Questions! . What are some other names for procedures?: . Processes or Functions. . Why are procedures effective?: . Procedures are effective because they have the ability to change the result of a piece of code without actually changing the calls to the program. This is effective because it is easier than going into a function and changing different variables and sub functions and risk causes errors. . Additional Notes! . Procedure can or can no return a value. Values include numbers and booleans. Procedure works similarly to a function. Defining the procedure calls it along with setting its parameters. Parameter is the value(s) that would be used in the procedure to determine the output. Procedures have the ability to change the result without changing the calls to the program. . In java, you call a prodecure by defining its function. Defining the function allows values to change the parameters, resulting in a new outcome. Those new values are normally inputed by the coder in the code, not in a input, but it can be. . Procedural Abstraction provides a name for a process that makes it so a procedure can be used knowing what it does. Kind of like defining a function. This allows the code to use the procedure in different situations. . Modularity is used to help identiy any sort of issues that arise in the code. It breaks down the code, making the error easier to see. . Challenge 1: . Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): return bin(n) print(convertToBinary(decimal)) . 0b111 . Challenge 2: . Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . def findMax(numberA, numberB): if numberA &gt; numberB: print(&quot;Max: &quot; + str(numberA)) elif numberA &lt; numberB: print(&quot;Max: &quot; + str(numberB)) else: print(&quot;Max: &quot; + str(numberA) + &quot; numberA and numberB are equal&quot;) def findMin(numberA, numberB): if numberA &lt; numberB: print(&quot;Min: &quot; + str(numberA)) elif numberA &gt; numberB: print(&quot;Min: &quot; + str(numberB)) else: print(&quot;Min: &quot; + str(numberA) + &quot; numberA and numberB are equal&quot;) findMax(3, 4) findMin(3, 4) #Call both functions so that the parameters numberA and numberB are given a value. #Optional bonus- create a procedure that can determine the minimum or maximum value out of more than two parameters. . Max: 4 Min: 3 . Homework/Hacks: . For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): binary = [] decimal = [] for i in x: decimal.append(ord(i)) # ord converts characters to ASCII decimal for i in decimal: binary.append(int(bin(i)[2:])) # bin converts deciaml to binary return binary xlist = &quot;APCSP&quot; result = charToBinary(xlist) print(xlist + &quot; in binary is&quot;) print(result) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get # &#39;&#39;APCSP&#39;&#39; in binary is # [1000001, 1010000, 1000011, 1010011, 1010000] xlist = &quot;Lucas Moore 16&quot; result = charToBinary(xlist) print(xlist + &quot; in binary is&quot;) print(result) .

Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Unit 3.15 Random Values . Purpose/Objectives: Teach student how to implement randomness into their code to make their code simulate real life situations. . In this lesson students will learn: . How to import random to python | How to use random with a list or number range | How to code randomness in everyday scenarios | . What are Random Values? . Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring. . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . What are Examples of Random outputs in the world? Add a few you can think of. . Ex: Marbles | Dice Roll | Blind guesses | . Why do we need Random Values for code? . Random values can be used in coding: .

            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. It is not 3 because 9 is greater than 2^3=8. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 .",

Index: False . Developing Algorithms . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | The algorithm checks if the number in num is able to be divided by num2. If it can, the algorithm will print &quot;true&quot;. If it can not, the algorithm will print &quot;false&quot;. This algorithm has num = 20 and num2 = 4. 20/4 = 5 with a remainder of 0 so the result is true. . What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? | If you put in 30 as num and 4 as num2, the result would be false because 30/4 = 7 with a remainder of 2, not a remainder of 0. . Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? . This algorithm has 3 outputs. If temp is greater than or equal to 90, the code will print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot;. If temp is not greater than or equal to 90, it will go into another if else statement and ask if temp is greater than or equal to 65. If temp is greater than or equal to 65 while being less than 90, the code will print &quot;I will go outside&quot;. If temp is not greater than or equal to 65, the code will print &quot;it is too cold outside&quot;. . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! . This algorithm has 3 outputs. If temp is greater than or equal to 90, the code will print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot; and &quot;I will go outside&quot;. If temp is greater than or equal to 65, it will print &quot;I will go outside&quot; and could print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot; if temp is also greater than or equal to 90. If temp is not greater than or equal to 65, the code will print &quot;it is too cold outside.&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers.

            "content": "&lt;-&gt; . HOMEWORK IS LOCATED AT THE END OF THE BLOG! . &lt;-&gt; . Searching Introduction . What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. It is not 3 because 9 is greater than 2^3=8. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Index: False . Developing Algorithms . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. | The algorithm checks if the number in num is able to be divided by num2. If it can, the algorithm will print &quot;true&quot;. If it can not, the algorithm will print &quot;false&quot;. This algorithm has num = 20 and num2 = 4. 20/4 = 5 with a remainder of 0 so the result is true. . What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? | If you put in 30 as num and 4 as num2, the result would be false because 30/4 = 7 with a remainder of 2, not a remainder of 0. . Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? . This algorithm has 3 outputs. If temp is greater than or equal to 90, the code will print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot;. If temp is not greater than or equal to 90, it will go into another if else statement and ask if temp is greater than or equal to 65. If temp is greater than or equal to 65 while being less than 90, the code will print &quot;I will go outside&quot;. If temp is not greater than or equal to 65, the code will print &quot;it is too cold outside&quot;. . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! . This algorithm has 3 outputs. If temp is greater than or equal to 90, the code will print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot; and &quot;I will go outside&quot;. If temp is greater than or equal to 65, it will print &quot;I will go outside&quot; and could print &quot;it is too hot outside&quot; if temp is also greater than or equal to 90. If temp is not greater than or equal to 65, the code will print &quot;it is too cold outside.&quot; . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 counter = 1 for i in range (0, 5): sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 print(sum) . 25 . Developing Algorithms (JavaScript) . Review . if-else statements . Syntax: . if (condition) { } else if (condition 2) { } else { } . for loops . for (let i = number; i &lt; number; i++) { // code } . Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; rainy = false; . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . The code above is the same as below: . umbrella = !sunny &amp;&amp; rainy; console.log(umbrella); . To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . def sqrt(N): # Write your code here square = 0 r = 0 while square &lt;= N: r += 1 square = r*r return r - 1 print(sqrt(144)) . 12 . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() .

What is a conditional? . A conditional is a statement that affects the flow/outcome of a program by executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement. That true or false statement is a boolean expression. . Conditionals appear in almost every programming language because of how important it is for changing the flow of the program. . Conditionals statements are used by the selection process for a program. . Question: What statement most commonly fills the role of a conditional in almost all programming languages? . If/Else and If Statements . In almost every programming language, if/else statements fill in the role of the conditional. Some languages call this switch blocks but if/else is the most used term. . if (&quot;condition&quot;): (&quot;first statement&quot;) else: (&quot;second statement&quot;) . If/Else Statement can have more than one if condition. . If/Else Statement Example: . number = 3 # value that will affect true or false statement if number == 5: # if part determines if the statement is true or false compared to another part of the program. print(&quot;yes, 5 does equal 5&quot;) else: #else part only executes if the if part is false print(&quot;no, &quot; + str(number) + &quot; does not equal 5&quot;) . no, 3 does not equal 5 . If/Else Statements can also just be if statements. This can be used more as an interruption rather then yes or no response. . If Statement Example: . progress = 0 while progress &lt; 100: print(str(progress) + &quot;%&quot;) if progress == 50: print(&quot;Half way there&quot;) progress = progress + 10 print(&quot;100%&quot; + &quot; Complete&quot;) . 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% Half way there 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Complete .

For Loops: For Loops makes it so that a function or multiple functions with loop for a set amount of things or numbers. It is good for checking something in a list because it does the function one by one. | Recursive Loops: Recursive Loops are functions that loop other functions until something else happens. It&#39;s like &quot;do this until that&quot;. This can work like a for loop but is used for a lot more other functions. | While Loops: While Loops are very similar to recursive loops.

[73, 55] [73, 55] . Struggle . I was struggling with Challenge 3.8. For some reason that is unknown to me, the output would contain values that didn&#39;t seen possible based on the restrictions of the code. I was unable to find out why. However, the code in challenge 3.8 does produce the same results but instead of starting with the whole list and removing the values over 100, the code starts the list with nothing and adds the values less than 100. Instead of the .remove function, the code used .append which for this list I think is better because most of the values are over 100. .",

A Protocol, no matter the type, does not effect the user’s internet connection and ensures equal bandwidth on the Internet. That is all decided by the device the user is using. Open protocols in the internet set a strandard of how data is transmitted between different manufacturers. Open protocol’s primary reason is to allow other devices to communicate. . Question 21 . . I chose (C) but the correct answer was (D). Binary sequences can be used to represent strings of characters, colors, and audio recordings. In fact, binary sequences can be used to represent almost anything. This makes Binary so popular, it only uses two symbols and can be used for anything. . Question 36 . . I chose (D) but the correct answer was (C). (D) is incorrect because it doesn’t generate the list with the starting value of 2. It goes 1 to 1+1 to 2 * 1+1 which equals 4, not 2. However, (C) is correct because the starting value of the list is 2. It goes 2 * 1 and then 1 to 1+1 but that is not shown. The first thing displayed is 2, making (C) the correct answer. . Question 39 . . I chose (B) but the correct answer was (D). An index for a list is the position in the list noted as a integer. A position in a list can also not be negative because list don’t have negative listed items. This makes it so that the answer needs to be a positive integer and the only one of those is (D) which is 4. .",

This is an image of a room that contains Valentine’s Day decorations. The shape used the most is the heart as that is what is used to represent love during Valentine’s Day. The art piece also uses many colors to bring the room and the objects in it to life. . . Ceramics . Ceramics is an art class that uses clay to build unique objects that can express ones own artistic style. Here is an image of an art piece from that class. It is a pot that is shaped as a chess rook and that sits on top of a chess board. The piece is made up of only two colors, probably so that the piece is designed similarly to a traditional chess board. . . Drawing and Painting . Drawing and Painting is using a canvas to draw or paint to express an unlimited amount of style and/or emotion. This trimester, it looks like the students were using aluminum cans to make their art pieces. This one is of a bald eagle surrounded by grassland and trees. The aluminum can gives the bald eagle a 3d effect that brings out the bird and makes it stand out from traditional drawings of art. . . Improvements and New Ideas for the Next Trimester . Improvements . For this Trimester, my group’s theme was food and builted a website based on it. Each of us contributed to the website by making a section that was individually created. This allowed us each to grow and become less dependent of each other as we were coding. However, we were not fully independent. Near the end of the creation of the project, most of the sections were still having problems. When one of us tried to ask for help from the others, the other three team members were unable to help not just because they had their own code to work on but because they didn’t know how the asker’s code worked. Each member had not had an understanding of how their teammates code worked and resulted in less team collaboration. For the next project in the next trimester, my team and I will need to REMIND each other to look at each others code and to help if they can and even use their teammates code to help themselves. The coding this trimester(at least for me) was better. It took a while and was difficult but I think with more experience and learning more on the way, my coding abilities will improve. . New Ideas . As stated in the improvements, an idea that can be beneficially for the team is sharing code with each other in order to help everyone. Helps both sides because they all can learn from going over code that needs fixing. This would be very useful for data structures as everyone would be using similiar methods for gathering data. Another idea could be to stick the group with data that is formatted the same in order for the group to have a clearer understanding on how it is being used in code. .",

Improvements and New Ideas for the Next Trimester . Improvements . The Hangman game created by team Lyntax was very good. It did everything we wanted it to do and the people who tested it enjoyed the project. However, even though the project accomplished the goals team Lyntax set for it, there is still room for improvement. Not much on the actual code but more on time management. There were steps that were set for us to complete but we would have some of the steps incomplete and resulted in a lot more work near the end of the project’s due date. To fix this, in the future, the steps that must be completed should be tracked by the day not the week. This will make it so work is done equal on each day instead of rushing it all on the last day. . New Ideas . As stated as an improvement, steps that would be complete would be tracked by the day not the week. Or at least more often resulting in more progress. Project ideas should also be brainstormed before even early planning in order to have more time. Project could and maybe even should be more simple. When browsing other programs made by other groups, most of the programs were not as complicated as a simulated game of hangman. I fear if future projects are even more complicated, we would be reaching out too far and would end up with a result that would not met requirements. However, it is good to challenge oneself as long as it is still possible. .",

Right before we finish and mark the code as complete, we will go around the classroom and ask others for their feedback. We will take in this feedback and use it to make any final corrections and then mark the hangman program as complete. | . | . Problems and their Solutions . For week 2, no problems have arised. However, we have been struggling with some parts of the code, mainly converting it to frontend. But this is part of our learning and the development process.

            "content": "Week One Progress . During Week One, my group completed the basic components of our final project, Hangman. Below is a list of those components. . Word API My group was able to make their own API that contains many words and provides that given word&#39;s definition. It was created in week one but will be updated through out the entire development process. | . | Letters We have added our own keyboard into the code that the user will be interacting with. It was created in week one but is under further development in order for it to produce an output that another part of the program can use. | . | Hangman A drawing of a stick figure being hanged on a gallow is displayed under the random definition and over the program&#39;s own keyboard. It was created in week one as a single image but will flip through muiltiple images that will represent the stage of the hangman in future development. | . | . Current Progress . As of the now, the following is currently under development. . Space for word A Space for a word is being made that will display the mystery word as it is being revealed by the user. The word will be split into spaces for each letter of that word. For example, if the word is &quot;solve&quot;, the space for the word would look like &quot; _&quot;. | . | Space for incorrect letters A Space for letters that is not in the mystery word will be made. If the user selects a letter and that letter is not apart of the mystery word, it will be put in a separate section titled &quot;Incorrect Letters&quot;. | . | . Problems and their Solutions . As of now, the only problem we ran into was a merge conflict. This was caused because of a delay in a push/pull action from one team member and occured when another team member was making their own push. The problem was resolved by going through the timeline and separating the two commits. However, this was an event that shown us the importance of Live Share Programming. Live Share Programming allows multiple people to code on the same program at once while seeing their teammates live changes and without merge conflicts. .",

A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that send and/or receive data. A computer network is a type of computer system. The message a device sends goes on a path that is inbetween the sender and the receiver. There is also another device called the router that finders the path between the sender and the receiver. Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that a device can send in a certain amount of time. . Why do computers need to connect? . Computers connecting allows for us, the users, to communcaite with other people from different places. . Why do we use packets to transmit data? . We use packets to transmit data because taking a small piece of data at a time is better than needing to take it through all at once. . About the Internet . The Internet is a computer metwork with interconnected networks that use open communication protocols. Protocols are set rules that specify the behaviors of systems. Users can easily connect computing devices to the internet because of its open protocols. The Internet Engineering Task Force is what set the internet&#39;s protocols. Computers use numbers to talk not letters. The internet is flexable around the rounters is bounes off of. A local area network is internet connected to rounters in an organization. Theses are linked by Intranets. Autonomous systems are networks linked together by large intranets. The Internet is millions of autonomous systems linked together.

            "content": "Main Ideas: . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words. . Program, Purpose, and Function: The purpose of this program is to test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. The users must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. . | Data Abstraction: The program will need to have lists, dictionaries, and an API. Mostly likely, the lists and dictionaries will be located inside an API. This API will have the definitions and words that will be used for hangman. My group will use the API and code around it so that the user can guess the word in a style that simulates hangman. . | Managing Complexity: The API is what is being coded around so that will organize the code. However, this only displays what to display. My group will need to program the functions of the inputs and outputs. This will still be connected to the API. . | Procedural Abstraction: There will be a function in the program that determines if the inputed word and the unknown word and the same. This is important to the rest of the program because this will display that the game is over and the code can end or move on to a different segment of the code. This line of code gives the other code segments purpose. . | Algorithm Implementation: The program have a API and code in the program will loop the APi in order to gain more words and definitions and display them. More will be explained once the code segment is actually created. . | Testing: The main call used in the hangman program would be the event when the user inputs a word. When the user puts in a word, a function will check if it matched with the unknown word. If they do not, the user guesses again and calls the same function from earlier. . |",

Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program. These are Logic, Syntax, run-time, and overflow errors. . Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn&#39;t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as &quot;crashing&quot; and the error is normally referred to as a &quot;bug&quot;. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data. . | Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program&#39;s language, resulting in restrictions. . | Ways to Correct Errors: . IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn&#39;t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | Testing a Program . Programmers are planning program tests at the beginning of development. They determine the program&#39;s specifications and inputs and ask themselves how will they know if the program is working correctly. The Defined inputs used to test the program demonstrate different outcomes that would be expected, no matter if it works or not. When the inputs and outputs are matched, the programers test the code. After the test, programmers use the infomation that the program give them and revise, refine, and/or improve their work. Then they test again, make more changes, test again, and again. Once the programmers made clear results that they wanted, they let users test it and make more changes from that. After all that, the program is finished and can be released but even still, most of the time they will still be changes that must be fixed. . Hacks: Test Planning . What errors may arise in your project? In program development, many errors eccour but most of them are small. These small errors could be an incorrect line of code, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so ALL ERRORS MUST BE FIXED in our code. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? The desried inputs for my team&#39;s program would be english words but we must test more than that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them. | . | .",

Computing innovation has a purpose because understanding the purpose of the innovation helps the developers improve their skills and ability to create the computing innovation they are working on. All computing innovations are builted with a purpose in mind because that is what guides the development process of the innovation. The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or pursue interests. Most of the problems are not necessary but does make our daily lifes a lot easier. For the innovation made in this class, its purpose is to teach them about code and/or shown what they learned. . Inputs, Events, Actions, and Outputs: . Inputs are data that are sent into a computer for it to process through a given program. Forms of Input include text, numerical values, visual, tactile, and audio. Additionally, an event that triggers an action supplies a given input to the program it is in. A input can also be an action that triggers an event. To put it simiply, inputs can come from a user or other parts of the program. Event-driven programming results in program statements becoming active when triggered. The program can jump between code segment based on the event. Those events can be caused by anything; key pressed, mouse clicked, program started, timer, and many more. The inputs created normally affect other events and the output produced by a program. All of these types of inputs and events normally results in outputs. Program outputs are data sent from a program to the user or device. They can come in many different forms including but not limited to tactile, audio, visual, or text. Computer Programs take inputs in many different ways allowing them to influence the program&#39;s behavior differently. . Details About a Program: . A program is a collection of program statements that do a specific task when run. A program is also called software. A Program must be flexiable to work with different inputs and situations. The behavior of a program is how the program functions while it&#39;s running and is often affected by the user. A Program can be described based on what is does and also by how the program statements state the functions. A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.

            "content": "Important Notes from the Video: . Most college students feel a lot of anxiety and overwhelmed and results in them not having the free time to do the things they love. They are so stressed that they don’t focus on the college’s extra opportunities they offer. | College students sometimes miss out on what college has to offer because they feel stressed, anxious, lonely, and/or depressed. | It doesn’t matter how much you know about happiness and the actions needed to get it, if you don’t do those actions, you will never be any more happier. | It is hard to predict what will make us happy because what we think will create happiness, doesn’t make us happy enough. | The best way to create happiness is to permanently build daily habits. | A great way to maintain happiness is to make free time for social connections. It doesn’t need to be between friends or family, a social interaction with a stranger can boost your happiness a lot more than just being alone. | People feel more happy when they put in the time to help someone other than themselves. Sometimes a person gives something to someone else because that thing given to another person would have more value to them than to keep it themselves. | Most people look at their lives and focus on the negatives. Doesn’t matter how much of their life is positive, they only bring up the negatives. However, happy people do the opposite and focus on the positives. | A good way to force yourself to be happy is to simply just write down what you are grateful for whether that be a person, a thing, a situation, or your beliefs. | Staying physically healthy is tied to and is very efficient for staying mentally healthy. Best physical activities for having good mentally health are daily exercise and a good amount of sleep. | People need to focus on the moment they are currently in and notice what is making them happy right then and there. This ties into what was said about thinking about what you are grateful for. | Being wealthy in time is better than being wealthy with money because time allows for more socialization, freedom, and more chances to gain happiness. | . How to use the &#8220;Psychology and the Good Life&#8221;: . In order to get the good life that was described in the video, you must change your attitude, your habits, and your goals. People in today&#39;s society value their own productivity more than their mental health. They may feel more accomplished but that doesn’t make them happy. We also always think of what we don’t have and what we struggle with in our day to day lives. This attitude focuses so much on the negatives of life that the positive things that we should be grateful for are overshadowed. The best way to force yourself to be happy is to change your attitude and your habits. In order to put those forces in effect, you need to set up goals. Changes towards your attitude can include being more open to others, focusing on what you are grateful for, and trying new things. Some of the changes towards your habits include being more social, thinking about what you are grateful for, and exploring new experiences. Goals created that include the goal’s purpose, time measurement, and task are solid goals to use if you want to change yourself. To summarize, we need to change our mindset and habits in order to obtain a happy life because these are the two main factors that influence our mood and because if we don’t change them, we won’t become any happier. . Practice Activities: . I am grateful for . . . . My family | My friends | My food | My house | Access to great education | My teachers | Access to clean water | My good health | Access to technology. | . Goals used to increase my mental health and be happy: . Do well in school | focus more on the positives of things | Stay physically healthy | Help others | Make new friends | Don&#39;t let self-inflicted stress overwhelm me | Find the fun in everything. | . Notes of Gratitude: . To my friend, Abtin, I would like to thank you for being a friend and supporting me. You always were the one in any given group to bring the most fun. You introduced me to many activites that I still partaking in. You are also the sole reason I met many other people that I am still friends with to this day.

Their are things we don&#39;t know how to do, can&#39;t do by ourself, or maybe not know the best choice out of multiple other choices. Many things in life are like this. You are assigned to do something that requires multiple different skills but you don&#39;t know all of them. However, collaborating with other people can help us with those problems. Collaboration allows for each person in a group to display their own set of skills while those skills connect to and support eachother in order to create a solution. This shows the people in a group their own strenghts and weaknesses. They can then learn from their individual weaknesses and from the weaknesses as a group in order to become better workers and teammates. Collaboration is important because no one is perfect, but we can collaborate in order to keep getting better and better. . When people are trying to create something or solve a problem, their is always bias. Everyone is bias and even a small amount of bias can affect a product or solution significantly. Fortunately, people collaborating together results in many different perspectives being expressed which results in everyone in the group becoming more open to new ideas. This open-minded thinking can result in a more effective product or solution. Colloboration helps decreases bias by having different perspectives in mind that can lead to the best possible outcome. .

Ways to collaborate in APCSP: . Pair-Programing: Pair programing is when two programers are given different roles and use their role to program. One role is called the driver and it is the person who is writing the code and the other role is the observer who reviews the lines of code as the driver types it. Helps with having a different perspective and new ideas. . Think-Pair-Share: Think-Pair-Share is a process where students think alone, share their ideas with a partner, and then share the ideas they and their partner came up with to the class. . Commenting on code: Commenting on code is used to communicate with yourself and your partners in order for you guys to gain a better understanding of the lines of code. This is when you would explain what the code does or should be doing. Comments are also a place to site sources to give credit and to look back at. It is also where you differentiate who did what code. . Tools: . repl.it: multiplayer(A place where multiply people can code at once.) | Github: collaboration with groups and repositories that allow you to save your work and have other people comment on your work. | Shared document or folder(you can share through google drive.) | Ask people to test out your program and for them to give feedback. | Check in with your teacher to talk about your code. | .

Success . The greatest success for me was me being able to easily understand how to make a quiz using block code. The code was basic which resulted in less complex work while also allowing it to be very clear to understand. The next time I use block code, I will remember that it is not too complicated and that I could try to import new ideas into my future codes with more ease. . Discoveries . I discovered that block coding and coding done in programs like python are very similar. This has allowed me to look at coding differently. Seeing line code simplified into blocks makes line code look easier to create. | I found out that the functions needed to create this quiz were very repetitive which made the coding process take less time. If I create another quiz like the one made here, I will use the same functions in order to have more time to create new ones. | Code.org explains what each of their blocks does by hovering over a block with the mouse. This has helped me whenever I got stuck. | . Challenges . While planning out the quiz with my parter, we were struggling to come up with a topic and then struggled to come up with quesitons for the topic. Thankfully, we got through that stage quickly and were able to get started on code.org. This taught me to choice a larger topic to focus on as it is easier to pull infomation from it. | During the coding process, I had trouble trying to display the score variable. I solved this by having each possible score output display its own screen. While this solution worked, I bielieve that there could have been another way that was easier. In the future, I will always make sure I choice the better solution and not just take the first one I find. | . . To summarize, this project has taught me much about block coding and that knowledge has enhanced my understand of code as a whole but I still have a lot to learn. .",

Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because when they were supposed to respond with the program’s purpose, they talked about what the program does. They needed to talk about the why, not the how. | NA | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because both code segments provided are lists(arrays). The responses and code segments also do not provide reasoning for being in the code other than it shortens the code’s length. | NA | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because there is no code that shows the use of the lists. There is only an explanation but that is just saying that the code is shorter because of it. | NA | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the written response describes what happens in the procedure independently and not to the rest of the program. They needed to explain the purpose of this piece of code for the entire program and not just what the given part does by itself. | NA | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the written response doesn’t include detailed steps on how to recreate the algorithm if someone else wanted to. | NA | . Testing | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the calls used go through different parts of the algorithm and the conditions and the results make sense based on the code segments. | NA | . Table for Submission 2 . Category My Scoring College Board Scoring My Comments What I missed if scoring is different . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the written response actually states the purpose of the program even if part of the function that is stated in the purpose/function is not shown in the video. The response talked about a use of images. | NA | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the code segments make it very clear that the list is needed in the function for its data to assist in the rest of the program. Uses comments as well. | NA | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the students clearly explained why using lists to store their data is better for managing complexity with random than using individual lines of code. It is shown that the code was made efficient and with the need of a list. | NA | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the written response linked the purpose and function of the code back to its function and purpose in the entire program. This part does include procedures in the procedure not stated in the written response but that doesn’t result in 0 points. | NA | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 1 | I gave this part a 0 because there was no step by step process that could recreate the procedure. The Procedure had procedures and those must have also been explained in order to recreate the main procedure’s function. | It does not need to tell the reader how to recreate the procedures inside the procedure but just needs to say that they called upon it. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the two different calls to through different code segments that result in the outputs being opposite from each other. | NA | . Table for Submission 3 . Category My Scoring College Board Scoring My Comments What I missed if scoring is different . Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the purpose provided was actually just the function of the program. | NA | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the list is a layout of how the code looks and meets the requirements and the purpose of the lists is shown by being used in the second piece of code. | NA | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the response explains how the list stores the information about the characters so that they don’t need to be called upon individually. This manages the program’s complexity. | NA | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the procedure meets all the requirements and is shown where it is called and the purpose of this part of the code it explained. | NA | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the detailed explanation is formatted in a process to recreate the algorithm and also includes how they used sequencing, selection, and iterion in the program. | NA | . Testing | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the two different calls to through different code segments that result in the outputs being opposite from each other while also explaining how. | NA | . Table for Submission 4 . Category My Scoring College Board Scoring My Comments What I missed if scoring is different . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the purpose written in the response was actually a purpose and not a summary of the program’s function. | NA | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the second piece of code does not use any of the information from the list shown in the first piece of code. | NA | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the second piece of code has no use of the list shown in the first part. Instead of the list, it could just use a number to count the amount of guesses instead of using the list itself. | NA | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the two pieces of code meet what is required and the response explains the purpose of this part of the code. | NA | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | I gave this part a 1 because the explanation of the code is a process for recreating the algorithm and it also includes how it used sequencing, selection, and iterion. | NA | . Testing | 0 | 0 | I gave this part a 0 because the arguments used as the two tests were the same, just in a different state. It should have used the same word but the two tests would be different letters. | NA | . What will be needed to fulfill all requirements . Clear answers that respond to ONLY what is being asked of. | Clear answers that are detailed and specific to what is being asked. | An input that results in the program’s output | Explain and show how the input leads to an output | Have a list or lists that serve more than just holding data. | Be able to explain algorithms inside your code without explaining other parts that don’t affect that algorithm. | . Failed to meet the standards . For these four examples, a submission is most likely to fail to meet the standard by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, code segments, or the entire program or by not explaining how a program functions. Defining a program&#39;s funciton is not the same as defining the program&#39;s purpose and that misunderstanding will cost 1 point. There also must be a clear step by step porcess on how to recreate one of the pieces of code in the program to show a person&#39;s coding skills and to be able to earn a 1 for its category. .",

Support Thesis (aka Topic Sentence)– i.e. In the movie __, the character __ becomes a hero when __ (one of the stages). . In the movie Wreck it Ralph, the character Ralph displays the archetype hero when he faces obstacles that change and grow him as a person. Initially, Ralph is lonely, isolated, and misunderstood. He wants to be accepted and not seen as the bad guy anymore in his video game. He jumps into another video game to prove to everyone that he could be a hero by winning the prized medal. However, he ends up being transported to Sugar Rush Land where he meets Penelope. This is significant because Penelope plays a big part of Ralph’s evolution.

She makes him realize that it’s better to have a true friend than a trophy. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #1 (you may paraphrase or quote the movie): .

In the beginning of the story, Ralph was selfish because he only wanted a medal so that he could get the approval from his co-workers. However, later on, he realized that having true friends is better than approval and that it is better to actually be a better person. This heroic act of sacrificing himself for the greater good displays the role of hero. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #2: . Another example of when Ralph represents actions of a hero is when he learned that Penelope’s racing could cause her to lose her life. In order for this to not happen, Ralph decided that the best course of action was to destroy her racing car. . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . While this seems like a cruel act to do, he displays archetype hero traits of protection and love. Heroes often are faced with making hard decisions that may hurt people, but they do it with good intentions. Ralph destroyed Penelope’s car because he didn’t want to lose his only friend and would rather risk their friendship than her life. This is a selfless act often seen by archetypal heroes. . Concluding Sentence . In conclusion, Ralph is an archetypal hero in Wreck it Ralph because he evolves from being a self-centered lonely character to one that would sacrifice everything he values for the greater good. . Do Heroes Make us Smarter Date: 12/7/2021 Assignment#: 7 Close reading practice . Article Notes . Do Heroes Make Us Smarter? . Heroes give us direction, wisdom, and emotional intelligence. . By Scott T. Allison, Ph.D., Psychology Today, Apr 13, 2014 . When legendary South African President Nelson Mandela passed away in 2013, the world responded with heartache mixed with reverence. President Barack Obama observed that Mandela “no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages.” With this statement, Obama illustrated what we have always done to our greatest heroes—we forge them in eternity. . Why do we idolize great heroic leaders? Obviously, heroes provide us with hope and inspiration. But my research on heroes reveals a surprising finding—they make us smarter, too. Heroes improve our intelligence about the world and teach us lessons about the trajectory of our own lives. Our research has uncovered four ways that heroes impart wisdom to us. . 1. Heroes teach us how to respond in crisis situations . In 2007, Wesley Autrey, a construction worker living in Harlem, received international acclaim when he rescued a complete stranger from an oncoming New York subway train. Autrey witnessed the man fall on the subway tracks just as a train was approaching. Realizing he had no time to move the man from the tracks, Autrey made the remarkable decision to lie down on top of him in-between the rails as the train passed over them both. Only one-half inch separated Autrey from severe injury or death. . After performing this heroic act, Autrey received hundreds of letters from people thanking him for showing them how to live their lives and how to respond in emergency situations. Autrey and other selfless heroes like him teach us what to do, and the right thing to do, in challenging situations. Heroes like Autrey provide a script for heroic action to a world hungry for such a script. . 2. Hero stories illuminate paradoxical life truths . Spiritual guru Richard Rohr argues that hero stories are saturated with complex life truths that are nearly impossible for humans to grasp unless they are illustrated inside a good hero story. Many of these truths are paradoxical secrets of human growth and development. For example, in a typical hero story, the hero cannot grow as a person until after he or she has experienced a significant falling or failing. “Where you stumble,” wrote comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, “there lies your treasure.” Other paradoxical truths in hero stories include the wisdom that (a) we must leave home to find home; (b) we must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; (c) we must surrender to win; and (d) we must give up something important to gain something important. . 3. Heroes teach us that their journey is the human journey . Joseph Campbell believed that the Hero’s Journey parallels human developmental stages. All young adults are driven out of their safe, familiar worlds and into the fearful real world. Psychologist Eric Erikson’s stages of human lifespan development suggest a hero trajectory during our lives, with young adults driven to establish competencies and carve out an identity for themselves. . Older adults reach a stage of generativity, which Erikson defines as people’s desire to create things that will outlast them and to give back to the society that has given them so much. Hero stories teach us that we are all developmentally equipped to pursue a lifelong hero-like journey. . 4. Heroes help us develop emotional intelligence . Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim believed that children’s fairy tales are useful in helping people, especially children, understand emotional experience. The heroes of these fairy tales are usually subjected to dark, foreboding experiences, such as encounters with witches, evil spells, abandonment, neglect, abuse, and death. Listeners to these tales develop strategies for resolving their fears and distress. . Bettelheim believed that even the most distressing fairy tales, such as those by the Brothers Grimm, add clarity to confusing emotions and give people a greater sense of life’s meaning and purpose. The darkness of fairy tales allows children to grow emotionally, thus developing their emotional intelligence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood. . Conclusion . Heroes give us far more than inspiration—they are our greatest teachers. Heroes show us the secrets to unlocking our fullest potential as human beings. They do so by role-modeling virtue, by clarifying complex and paradoxical life truths, by equipping us with emotional intelligence, and by revealing how their journey can be our journey, too. No wonder Obama said that Nelson Mandela “belongs to the ages.” The wisdom we get from our heroes has a timeless quality that helps us thrive as human beings. . | Purpose: To have an historic detail that supports their argument and can be relatable. .

Vera Atkins, 92, Spymaster for British, Dies . By Douglas Martin published in the New York Times, June 27, 2000 . Article Annotations . Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92. . Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for &#39;&#39;M.&#39;&#39; . But Ms. Atkins&#39;s steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny&#39;s lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins&#39;s heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France. . After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money. . &#39;&#39;I could not just abandon their memory,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.&#39;&#39; . She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. &#39;&#39;I was probably the only person who could do this,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.&#39;&#39; . The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess&#39;s reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz. . &#39;&#39;Oh no,&#39;&#39; he said, as if offended. &#39;&#39;It was 2,345,000.&#39;&#39; . Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother&#39;s last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later. . At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up &#39;&#39;to set Europe ablaze&#39;&#39; through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, &#39;&#39;It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.&#39;&#39; . Hitler said, &#39;&#39;When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.&#39;&#39; . Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster&#39;s assistant, Ms. Atkins. . The spymasters headed the unit&#39;s F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it. . The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens. . The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester. . They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds. . It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets. . At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service. . Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a &#39;&#39;sledgehammer,&#39;&#39; pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive. . One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, &#39;&#39;Road to Resistance,&#39;&#39;( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. &#39;&#39;Oh, the bloody English!&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.&#39;&#39; . Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its title from her first name. . Ms. Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987. . She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see France. . Editors&#39; Note: July 14, 2000, Friday An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times&#39;s research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications. Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins&#39;s background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins&#39;s retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased. . Editors’ Note: July 14, 2000 .

Within thy help and holy physic lies: . I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, . My intercession likewise steads my foe. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; . Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. . ROMEO . Then plainly know my heart&#39;s dear love is set . On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: . As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; . And all combined, save what thou must combine . By holy marriage: when and where and how . We met, we woo&#39;d and made exchange of vow, . I&#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, . That thou consent to marry us to-day. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! . Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, . So soon forsaken? young men&#39;s love then lies . Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. . Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine . Hath wash&#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! . How much salt water thrown away in waste, . To season love, that of it doth not taste! . The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, . Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; . Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit . Of an old tear that is not wash&#39;d off yet: . If e&#39;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, . Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: . And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then, . Women may fall, when there&#39;s no strength in men. . ROMEO . Thou chid&#39;st me oft for loving Rosaline. . FRIAR LAURENCE .

To turn your households&#39; rancour to pure love. . ROMEO . O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast. . | Romeo states that he was with his enemy and was hurt and now needs help from a holy man in order to heal. After Friar tells him to stop speaking in riddles, Romeo contradicts his original statement and says that he is in love and is happy and needs help from a holy man to become even more happier. . | Remedy: a medicine, treatment or something that heals someone from a disease or injury. . Intercession: praying for another person. . Friar states that young men’s love lies in his eyes, not his heart. What Friar Laurence means by this is that young men only have love for the beauty that they can see and not the beauty within a person. They believe in the idea of love at first sight. . | Doting: very fond of someone or something. . Friar thinks Romeo is being irrational by letting go of Rosaline after trying to get her to love him for so long. He thinks Romeo is being weak to allow himself to fall in love with another woman so quickly.

The Friar and Romeo disagree about the validity of Romeo’s love. What reason does Romeo offer for the validity of his love? Why does the Friar think that Roseline scorned Romeo? What type of conflict is this? Who is right- Romeo or the Friar? Why? . | Romeo defends his logic on love by claiming that Rosaline never truly loved him and he found someone who truly loved him back. Friar thinks that Roseline scorned Romeo because he thought Romeo was so committed to making Rosaline love him that the only way Romeo would leave her was if she broke his heart. This type of conflict is inner conflict because it is Romeo vs his own passion for Juliet. I think Romeo is right to let Rosaline go because their relationship would never have worked out because it lacked true love. . Highlight the Friar’s warning in his final line. How is his warning similar to Juliet’s in Act 2.2 “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;/ Too like the lightning which doth cease to be” (Act 2.2 lines 129-130) . | Both statements are warnings to Romeo that imply that if their relationship moves too fast and without careful planning, it will start to crumble.

O my love! my wife!   92   Death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath,   93   Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: .  94   Thou art not conquer&#39;d; beauty&#39;s ensign yet   95   Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,  .  96   And death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there.  .  97   Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?   98   O, what more favor can I do to thee,  .  99   Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain  . 100   To sunder his that was thine enemy?  101   Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,  102   Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe  103   That unsubstantial death is amorous,  104   And that the lean abhorred monster keeps  105   Thee here in dark to be his paramour?  . 106   For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;  107   And never from this palace of dim night  108   Depart again. Here, here will I remain  109   With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here  110   Will I set up my everlasting rest,  111   And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars  112   From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!  113   Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you  114   The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss  . 115   A dateless bargain to engrossing death!             [Kisses Juliet, then speaks to the container of poison.]  . 116   Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!  117   Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on  . 118   The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!  119   Here&#39;s to my love!             [Drinks.]  119                                           O true apothecary!  120   Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.  . | Romeo is describing that Juliet is now dead but that death had not taken her beauty. This is verbal irony because Romeo says Juliet loses the sweet side of her( the honey) but states that she is still beautiful. . | This is a metaphor comparing poison to a guide. Romeo calls the poison a guide because he believes the poison will lead him to the afterlife where he could find Juliet. . | There are more words about death than the ones about love because this scene is Romeo talking about how death took Juliet and is now wanting death to take him as well. Him referring to death a lot makes it sound like he is calling for death and is begging for death to take him to Juiliet. . | | . Write the answers to the questions next to the place in the text where you found the answer. Number the questions. Explain the answers. . Text-Based Questions . Highlight lines 92-93. To the right of the lines, explain what Romeo is doing. Identify the literary device. . | Find an example of a simile or a metaphor. Highlight it and to the right explain what is being compared. . | Highlight words that refer to love in pink. Highlight words that refer to death in orange. Are there more of one? If yes, which? And, why? . | Inference and Analysis Questions: Write your answers next to the corresponding lines. . Highlight line 111. Explain what “inauspicious stars” are. Find one other example in the play and write it down. Cite your example with act, scene, and line numbers. . | Inauspicious stars are the stars in the sky that result in someone’s unlucky fate. Romeo saying this is him saying that he is breaking free from his fate by killing himself. After hearing the false news about Juliet’s death and believing in it, Romeo says “Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars! (5,1,2830)” . Highlight lines 117-118. Compare the metaphor in these lines to Act 2.2.82-83 “I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far/ As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,/ I should adventure for such merchandise” In each line, the “pilot” (captain of a ship) is different. Explain the difference. . | The difference between the pilot in this scene and the pilot in Act 2.2.82-83 is that the pilot from act 2 is a new pilot that is ready for adventure. In this scene however, the pilot is now experienced and is now sick of his adventures. The pilot being Romeo, Romeo is sick of all the misery that is in his life and just wants to die to be with Juliet, his one true love. . Explain the effect of having Romeo directly talk to “death” in this monologue. . | Romeo directly talking to death affects the way the audience sees him. Romeo, who is so excited to take on the world in the first part of the play is now begging death to take him to Juliet. This shows that Juliet is now Romeo’s world and that Romeo would do anything to get back to it. . Close Reading and Writing Practice Act 3.5.1-16 Date: 2/10/2022 Assignment: 23 .

Juliet: Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day: It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear; Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree: Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. (5) . Romeo: It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night&#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. (10) I must be gone and live, or stay and die. . Juliet: Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: It is some meteor that the sun exhales, To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua: (15) Therefore stay yet; thou need&#39;st not to be gone. . | Jocund: lighthearted and cheerful. . Figurative language device: Metaphor-compares yon light to a meteor. . | . Summary: Juliet: It is not morning and you are leaving already? . Romeo: I must leave because if I do not, I will be found in broad daylight and I will be killed ________________by the prince’s men. . Juliet: But there is no daylight yet. The only way to see is with a torch. No one will find you in ________this darkness, so stay a little longer. I need you Romeo. . Level 2 Questions . How does Juliet attempt to change the world through language? . | Juliet attempts to change the world through language by making the world sound like a safer place. By doing this, Romeo might stay with Juliet a little longer. . Compare and contrast this scene to the balcony scene (2.2). Think about what Romeo thought when he saw Juliet? Explain what he thought. What is Juliet trying to do here? . | When Romeo saw Juliet in the balcony in act 2 scene 2, he referred to her as a holy person with great beauty, like an angel. In this act, Juliet is trying to convince Romeo to stay with her for a little longer. This is Juliet calling for a person he needs, which makes it now Juliet referring to Romeo as an angel. . What theme is being developed in this scene? A theme is a single word. What is the message that Shakespeare is developing in this scene? In other words, write a “themessage.” . | The theme of “loss.” Shakespeare develops the message that hatern can cause a person to be separated from you and love can make that separation feel like a loss. . Write your commentary. . What is the message that this quote supports? Love creates bonds that affect the actions of others. . Level 1 Commentary: The lines are about Juliet begging Romeo to stay with her in order to feel safer and because it might be the last time she would even see him. . Level 2 Commentary: Before Juliet met Romeo, she was a smart young woman that thought things through, but now that bonds have been formed between the two, Juliet’s love is taking actions in order to make Romeo stay, and in ways that she would have never done before. .

Romeo and Juliet has led us astray: Romantic love, love at first sight – it’s great theater but disastrous dating advice. . February 14, 2010 | By Andrew Trees | . “Romeo and Juliet has Led us Astray” Notes, Annotations, Answers to questions . What if Shakespeare had it wrong about love in Romeo and Juliet? In fact, what if all of us have it wrong and our ideals of love and romance are hopelessly awry? Although we are supposed to be celebrating our love for that special someone on Valentine&#39;s Day, perhaps the time has come to reconsider the concept of romantic love, at least as it has been conceived in Western societies. . As we busily track down red roses, the best chocolates and the finest champagnes, we need to ask whether, in the pursuit of the perfect romance, we haven&#39;t declared war on true love. Cupid&#39;s arrow does strike often, but with the U.S. divorce rate near 50%, one has to wonder whether the wound is particularly deep or long-lasting. (Love) . As I found when researching my book on the science of human attraction, our typical romantic beliefs are quite often wrong. For instance, even couples who are blissfully happy together can&#39;t count on a happy ending. The PAIR project, a long-term academic study of couples, found that those most in love when they marry are also the most likely to get divorced. . And the chemical attraction that many people rely on to choose a partner has been found to fade &quot;to neutrality&quot; in two to three years. That&#39;s right, neutrality, which might work well for Switzerland but is deadly for a marriage. . Perhaps most damning of all, I discovered that wife murderers tend to be strong subscribers to the romantic ideal. Take that, Romeo and Juliet. . Love and romance did not always rule the roost. As recently as the 1930s, American men ranked mutual attraction as only the fourth most important quality for a relationship, while women had it even lower, placing it fifth (in a 1956 survey, women dropped it all the way to sixth). But in recent decades, love has climbed to No. 1, accompanied by a rise in the importance of looks, which suggests that our romance with romance is long on style and short on substance. . I hate to sound unromantic on this day of all days, but perhaps it&#39;s time to place less emphasis on romantic attraction as the key to finding a partner. What can shoulder some of the load? I would suggest that we rely a little more on what science has discovered about human attraction. . For instance, some researchers can now predict whether a couple will stay together with far more accuracy than the couple themselves. And it has less to do with the things we might think, such as fighting, and far more to do with the things we take for granted, such as asking your spouse about his or her day. . That doesn&#39;t mean we need to jettison every aspect of chemical attraction. Several studies have found that for women, a man&#39;s body odor is a helpful guide to finding a good genetic match (but only if the woman is not taking an oral contraceptive, which reverses her usual smell preferences). Body odor doesn&#39;t sound very romantic, but perhaps the better question to ask is: How did our narrow ideal of romantic love come to hold such complete sway in the first place? . Imagine a dating world turned on its head, in which people were not given the freedom to opt into or out of a relationship -- such as a culture that practices arranged marriages. What researchers have found will be shocking to Westerners weaned on the idea of romantic love. . According to a 1982 study by two Indian researchers, the level of self-reported love in arranged marriages increased over time until they surpassed the level of self-reported love in marriages that were freely chosen. Incredible as it sounds, people with a very limited say in choosing their own spouses eventually became happier with their relationships than people with the freedom to choose anyone they wanted. . Although we almost always read Romeo and Juliet as the quintessential story of love at first sight, Shakespeare actually offered his own sly critique of romantic love at the beginning of the play. Romeo is pining away for love -- but not for Juliet. There is another fair damsel who has rejected Romeo&#39;s advances, and he declares himself inconsolable. He disdains finding someone else and tells Benvolio, &quot;Thou canst not teach me to forget&quot; -- which is, of course, precisely what happens a few scenes later when Romeo meets Juliet and realizes that he was completely wrong before and only now has discovered true love. . We never remember that part of the story, though, because if we think of Romeo and Juliet from that perspective, the whole play starts to skew in ways that contradict our usual romantic notions. . Perhaps the time has come for us to take a skeptical view of romance, particularly the over-the-top variety peddled so effectively on Valentine&#39;s Day. We should throw off the shackles of our reigning romantic orthodoxy and realize that Romeo and Juliet and its many cultural offspring have led us astray. Shakespeare&#39;s story may be transcendent entertainment, but it is disastrous dating advice. .

In the video, I learned that people in the future could look at today’s superheroes and think of them as our culture. This also made me wonder if we are looking at past cultures in the same way that future cultures might be looking at us. It made me wonder if people hundreds or even thousands of years ago were as attached to their gods, legends, or heros as people of today are to theirs. Heros can show the value of a culture because heroes are looked at as an ideal or the best a person can be. People who look up to a hero also want to be as good as them or at least the best they themself can be. This is the reason heroes were made and why many people inbrance their ideas, heroes bring out the best part of a person. A person showing the best part of themself could become a real life hero and can make the world better and safer. . Journal #2 Date: 1/4/2022 . Courage is possibly the most common trait for a hero. Courage is going after something and knowing that the journey to it will be dangerous and that you might end up failing. The heroic part about courage is that the hero knows that what they are doing is dangerous but chooses to continue on the journey because they are doing it for the greater good. A person that is courageous is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. He chose to go into the death star to save princess Leia knowing he and his group were outnumbered and were mostly likely going to be overpowered. He even went back to help the rebels blow up the death star, still being outnumbered and overpowered. Luke did this because it was for the greater good and was worth the risk. Everyday people teach us that we want someone that has greater traits such as courage to be a leader and a face for our community. . Journal #3 Date:1/26/2022 . Act 2.2-2.3 Writing Practice .

If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.” – Ernest Hemingway . What Ernest is saying is that when someone loses their love, they become lonely. Love will never have a happy ending because no one can escape death and the lovers’ separation would lead to depression for the longer lasting lover and a tragic ending. This happened when Juliet kills herself after seeing Romeo dead(3.5.3122-3137). Juliet’s end is a tragic one because of the loss causing her to become depressed. .

            "content": "The Development Process: . All programs are created because there was an idea. That idea is what gives the program a certain purpose. The best way developers turn their ideas into reality is by sticking to it and following a clear set of steps to create it. However, these steps are more of a guideline. The development of a program is a lot more exploratory and steps are normally followed based on what happens during development but some steps are essential. . First, the developers must observe the purpose or problem and then reflect on it. Here is where the developers gain an understanding of the requirements, constraints, and users interest. They can obtain this infomation by testing users, creating surveys, hosting interviews, or observing others. . | After observing, reflecting, and investigating, developers starts to plan how to build the program. This is when they start brainstorming ideas, planning out the code, and create a testing strategy on their work. . | Once the program has been made, the developers talk about how the program behaves and what it should do. They will test their program with outside users. They will look back at their work to make sure it meet all the requirements and put it in a prototype. This will allow the developers to make changes while running the framework. . | Now for the test. This might be the final step, but testing occurs during every step of the development process. Testing occurs on different levels including micro and macro. Finally, developers revisit and refine their program baesd on what was shown after the test, feedback provided from users, and their reflection on what they wanted the program to do. . | Acknowledgement in a Program . Program development is normally used by teams of people and is rarely done alone. Indivduals or smaller teams formed in a team would work on different components of the code. With many people working on the same program, all of them deserve to receive credit for their work. Their names must be written in the program and at the part of the code they worked on. A good place to give credit in a program is through comments. Comments can also direct people to the creater of the code segment to ask for help or to tell them that something is wrong. Speaking of lines of code, most of the time, developers use existing code segments, procedures, and algorithms to write their own program. The people that made the existing code are not part of the project but should still get credit. It should be documented by the author&#39;s name and where the code came from. . Program Documentation . Programmers create program documentation that is a description of the functions of code segments, events, roles, methods, procedures, or the whole program and how all of it was created. Program documentation is most commonly found in the code language&#39;s comments. Comments can be read by anyone in the code and have no affect on the program. Comments are a great tool because it is inside the code making it very easy to access. This helps programmers document their development at all times which is something everyone should be doing. The purpose of program documentation is to help development and maintain the program based on the description/infomation contained in it. Program documentation happens at anytime during development. At the beginning, developers list off the specifications of the program. During the production, developers track their process, issues, and successes. After the production, developers explain the overall process of their code and how it affects the whole program. . My Group Project Info: . Main Idea about the Project: . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. | . . | Purpose of Program: . The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. | . . | Brainstormed Ideas: . The game is going to be like traditional hangman but there are ideas that will make the coding more interesting and make it more fun for the user. . Timer: A timer can be added to the game to make it feel more fast paced. A timer will reset every time the user guesses a letter, no matter if it is right or wrong. If the timer finishes before the user guesses, it will automatically draw a body part and reset. . | Definition: A text box of the definition of the unknown word will appear. This definition will guide the user into guessing the correct word. . | | . . | Requirements and Constraints: . The requirement is to create a program with a eductional purpose and present it in class by the end of the trimester. It also must be a project that the group will not lose interest in in a few weeks. This will mean the project must be updated throughout the weeks even after the main code is complete. The biggest constraint for building this program is time. Me and my group only have a few weeks to create the code and are expected to receive many other assignments that might give us less time. That plus the lack of knowledge and experience. However, the point of this assignment is to enhance our knowledge and provide the coders with experience so this is less of a constraint and more of a learning opportunity. | . . | Project&#39;s Impact: The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words. | . | . .",

            "content": "Quiz Results . . Questions I missed . Question 6 . . I chose option (B) but the correct answer was option (A). Each packet contains data that will be transmitted and has metadata used to help that process but the metadata helps by containing infomation that determines the routing of that data. I said metadata contains the key needed to decrypt the data but that is not true. The computer receiving the data would be the one that has access to that key. . Question 20 . . I chose option (B) but the correct answer was option (C). I stated that only Goal II works but both Goal II and Goal III work. Goal III works with the metadata better than the data because the metadata contains the phone number of the callers and can identify the caller as a known criminal using this infomation. . Question 37 . . I chose option (D) but the correct answer was option (B). Both answers state that the time to draw n shapes is n^2 steps. However, option (D) states that that is an unreasonable amount of time while option (B) states that it is a reasonalbe amount of time. Option (B) is the correct answer because the time makes senses since it is drawing out a shape that would have 3 or more sides and might keep increasing. . Question 49 . . I chose option (C) but the correct answer was option (A). Option (C) doesn’t work because the variable “len” includes the max score resulting in the index being off by one. The index and the variable “len” might both be 2, making it so that the scores are never checked and resulting in a false outcome even if a student got the maximunm amount of points. In option (A), the length of score put into “len” doesn’t include the maximum score in index(1) and the score check can not be avoided since the loop is based on the size of “len” which is at least two. .",

Computing is almost everywhere nowadays and is making life for most people a lot easier. | On the flip side, there is so much technology that people are now starting to become dependent on it. This makes people rely so much on technology and slows down progress and what a person can or can not do. | . 2 | Computing is being used to solve many problems and to hold new acievements in our world. From needing to build a program to make a computer to sending people to the moon, computing allows humans to change things in the world that they couldn&#39;t do without computers. | However, while new technologies created by computing is being used to solve problems, it is also creating other problems. New technologies are taking up so much land and resources that wild life are lossing their homes and fail to find new ones. Everything has pros and cons and might have cons that outweigh the pros and that still implies to new technologies. | . 3 | Computing has made so many new uses for technology. A big one is creating things that are fun and/or relaxing. Video games and social media are the two big ones. They are used to simply past the time and/or have a good time and a break from the real world. | The things mentioned early can also be more than just a little distraction. It could go further and become an addiction. A person&#39;s addiction has a high chance of making that person less healthy as they would put their addcition before things that are more important. | . Dopamine Issues . Dopamine issues coming from the use of technoolgy does exist. It is very easy to lose oneself while using things like a phone, a computer, a gaming console, and more. Sometimes doing something online feels better than in real life and there are somethings online that you couldn&#39;t do in the real world. Things like being on my phone and playing video games is also effecting my personal studies and success for high school. Most of the time I need to focus on my school work rather than do what I want on my phone. . 5.2 Blog Reflection . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . In order for someone to empower themself in a digital world, they would need to have the basics for connecting to the digital space. They would need a computer, electric power, and connection to the world wide web and the internet. However, some people might not have the money for those things and/or might not be in an area that could connect to the digital space. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone who is empowered can be a messager for the person not empowered. They could also fund them so that they could buy things to make them empowered or talk to them about the benefits outweighing the negatives if they are just against the use of techonology as a whole. At Del Norte High School, I think the best thing people could do is to try to convert the school to use less techonolgy. However, with classes like APCSP, that may not be an option but is worth a shot on other classes that don&#39;t need computers as much. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . Digital empowerment is being blocked by red tape because setting up a system for the digital space can be hard and confusing and using techonolgy could be very difficult for someone who has never used it before. I don&#39;t think those problems are common in Del Norte but they are in other places that are poorer or are rural areas. . Canvas Bullet points .

The game in my CPT project could become too addictive and hurt the user&#39;s health over time as they keep on playing it. | Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . For the Pros, Internet blockers and the lack of admin&#39;s password makes it so that students can not harm or be harmed from cyberbullying and that they don&#39;t get distracted and stay on school websites and programs where they can do their work. For the cons, Internet blockers and the lack of admin&#39;s password can block access for programs or websites that students need in order to do thier work and can result in limiting their learning. . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . I am concerned that the digital divide will need to be fixed by having the empowered people go down to the people who aren&#39;t empowered rather than the people who are not empowered move up to the empowered people. This would hurt the empowered people and it wouldn&#39;t help the people that are not empowered that much. . 5.3 Blog Reflection . Computer Bias is when a computer does something based on something in its program being bias. Most of the time, a computer is bias because of the infomation it is given. The Infomation is normally gathered by humans or in a way that will be for humans. Humans have bias, so when computers use something based on humans like infomation, they may develop bias. .
