            "content": "Main Ideas: . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words. . Program, Purpose, and Function: The purpose of this program is to test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. The users must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. . | Data Abstraction: The program will need to have lists, dictionaries, and an API. Mostly likely, the lists and dictionaries will be located inside an API. This API will have the definitions and words that will be used for hangman. My group will use the API and code around it so that the user can guess the word in a style that simulates hangman. . | Managing Complexity: The API is what is being coded around so that will organize the code. However, this only displays what to display. My group will need to program the functions of the inputs and outputs. This will still be connected to the API. . | Procedural Abstraction: There will be a function in the program that determines if the inputed word and the unknown word and the same. This is important to the rest of the program because this will display that the game is over and the code can end or move on to a different segment of the code. This line of code gives the other code segments purpose. . | Algorithm Implementation: The program have a API and code in the program will loop the APi in order to gain more words and definitions and display them. More will be explained once the code segment is actually created. . | Testing: The main call used in the hangman program would be the event when the user inputs a word. When the user puts in a word, a function will check if it matched with the unknown word. If they do not, the user guesses again and calls the same function from earlier. . |",

Wizard of Oz | Crossing the First Threshold- Dorothy lands in Oz and kills the Wicked Witch of the West with her house.

He sacrifices himself to find ways out and to save people. | . Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone | Crossing the First Threshold - Harry crosses the first threshold into the wizarding world when he first enters Diagon Alley. This is where he first experiences meeting wizards, buying his first wand, and going to Gringotts Bank. | Hero = Harry Potter, the predominant persona in the series, represents the “hero” archetype.

Hero’s Journey/Character Archetype Paragraph Date: 12/2/2021 Assign #6 . Writing a Two Chunk: Use this handout (it will ensure that you have all of the parts) . Support Thesis (aka Topic Sentence)– i.e. In the movie __, the character __ becomes a hero when __ (one of the stages). . In the movie Wreck it Ralph, the character Ralph displays the archetype hero when he faces obstacles that change and grow him as a person. Initially, Ralph is lonely, isolated, and misunderstood. He wants to be accepted and not seen as the bad guy anymore in his video game. He jumps into another video game to prove to everyone that he could be a hero by winning the prized medal. However, he ends up being transported to Sugar Rush Land where he meets Penelope. This is significant because Penelope plays a big part of Ralph’s evolution. She brings out traits and emotions in him that he never knew he had, such as: playfulness, protectiveness, love, and trustworthiness. She makes him realize that it’s better to have a true friend than a trophy. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #1 (you may paraphrase or quote the movie): . During the climax of the movie, Ralph sends himself and hundreds of mentos into a volcano of hot coke knowing that it would kill him but would also end up killing the Cy-bugs that were terrorizing Sugar Rush. . . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . This part of the movie is important because it proves that Ralph is the hero. In a movie that uses the hero’s journey, the definition of a hero is the character that needs to overcome an obstacle that ends up changing the character. In the beginning of the story, Ralph was selfish because he only wanted a medal so that he could get the approval from his co-workers. However, later on, he realized that having true friends is better than approval and that it is better to actually be a better person. This heroic act of sacrificing himself for the greater good displays the role of hero. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #2: . Another example of when Ralph represents actions of a hero is when he learned that Penelope’s racing could cause her to lose her life. In order for this to not happen, Ralph decided that the best course of action was to destroy her racing car. . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . While this seems like a cruel act to do, he displays archetype hero traits of protection and love. Heroes often are faced with making hard decisions that may hurt people, but they do it with good intentions. Ralph destroyed Penelope’s car because he didn’t want to lose his only friend and would rather risk their friendship than her life. This is a selfless act often seen by archetypal heroes. . Concluding Sentence . In conclusion, Ralph is an archetypal hero in Wreck it Ralph because he evolves from being a self-centered lonely character to one that would sacrifice everything he values for the greater good. . Do Heroes Make us Smarter Date: 12/7/2021 Assignment#: 7 Close reading practice . Article Notes . Do Heroes Make Us Smarter? . Heroes give us direction, wisdom, and emotional intelligence. . By Scott T. Allison, Ph.D., Psychology Today, Apr 13, 2014 . When legendary South African President Nelson Mandela passed away in 2013, the world responded with heartache mixed with reverence. President Barack Obama observed that Mandela “no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages.” With this statement, Obama illustrated what we have always done to our greatest heroes—we forge them in eternity. . Why do we idolize great heroic leaders? Obviously, heroes provide us with hope and inspiration. But my research on heroes reveals a surprising finding—they make us smarter, too. Heroes improve our intelligence about the world and teach us lessons about the trajectory of our own lives. Our research has uncovered four ways that heroes impart wisdom to us. . 1. Heroes teach us how to respond in crisis situations . In 2007, Wesley Autrey, a construction worker living in Harlem, received international acclaim when he rescued a complete stranger from an oncoming New York subway train. Autrey witnessed the man fall on the subway tracks just as a train was approaching. Realizing he had no time to move the man from the tracks, Autrey made the remarkable decision to lie down on top of him in-between the rails as the train passed over them both. Only one-half inch separated Autrey from severe injury or death. . After performing this heroic act, Autrey received hundreds of letters from people thanking him for showing them how to live their lives and how to respond in emergency situations. Autrey and other selfless heroes like him teach us what to do, and the right thing to do, in challenging situations. Heroes like Autrey provide a script for heroic action to a world hungry for such a script. . 2. Hero stories illuminate paradoxical life truths . Spiritual guru Richard Rohr argues that hero stories are saturated with complex life truths that are nearly impossible for humans to grasp unless they are illustrated inside a good hero story. Many of these truths are paradoxical secrets of human growth and development. For example, in a typical hero story, the hero cannot grow as a person until after he or she has experienced a significant falling or failing. “Where you stumble,” wrote comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, “there lies your treasure.” Other paradoxical truths in hero stories include the wisdom that (a) we must leave home to find home; (b) we must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; (c) we must surrender to win; and (d) we must give up something important to gain something important. . 3. Heroes teach us that their journey is the human journey . Joseph Campbell believed that the Hero’s Journey parallels human developmental stages. All young adults are driven out of their safe, familiar worlds and into the fearful real world. Psychologist Eric Erikson’s stages of human lifespan development suggest a hero trajectory during our lives, with young adults driven to establish competencies and carve out an identity for themselves. . Older adults reach a stage of generativity, which Erikson defines as people’s desire to create things that will outlast them and to give back to the society that has given them so much. Hero stories teach us that we are all developmentally equipped to pursue a lifelong hero-like journey. . 4. Heroes help us develop emotional intelligence . Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim believed that children’s fairy tales are useful in helping people, especially children, understand emotional experience. The heroes of these fairy tales are usually subjected to dark, foreboding experiences, such as encounters with witches, evil spells, abandonment, neglect, abuse, and death. Listeners to these tales develop strategies for resolving their fears and distress. . Bettelheim believed that even the most distressing fairy tales, such as those by the Brothers Grimm, add clarity to confusing emotions and give people a greater sense of life’s meaning and purpose. The darkness of fairy tales allows children to grow emotionally, thus developing their emotional intelligence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood. . Conclusion . Heroes give us far more than inspiration—they are our greatest teachers. Heroes show us the secrets to unlocking our fullest potential as human beings. They do so by role-modeling virtue, by clarifying complex and paradoxical life truths, by equipping us with emotional intelligence, and by revealing how their journey can be our journey, too. No wonder Obama said that Nelson Mandela “belongs to the ages.” The wisdom we get from our heroes has a timeless quality that helps us thrive as human beings. . | Purpose: To have an historic detail that supports their argument and can be relatable. .

Vera Atkins, 92, Spymaster for British, Dies . By Douglas Martin published in the New York Times, June 27, 2000 . Article Annotations . Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92. . Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for &#39;&#39;M.&#39;&#39; . But Ms. Atkins&#39;s steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny&#39;s lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins&#39;s heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France. . After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money. . &#39;&#39;I could not just abandon their memory,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.&#39;&#39; . She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. &#39;&#39;I was probably the only person who could do this,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.&#39;&#39; . The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess&#39;s reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz. . &#39;&#39;Oh no,&#39;&#39; he said, as if offended. &#39;&#39;It was 2,345,000.&#39;&#39; . Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother&#39;s last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later. . At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up &#39;&#39;to set Europe ablaze&#39;&#39; through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, &#39;&#39;It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.&#39;&#39; . Hitler said, &#39;&#39;When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.&#39;&#39; . Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster&#39;s assistant, Ms. Atkins. . The spymasters headed the unit&#39;s F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it. . The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens. . The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester. . They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds. . It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets. . At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service. . Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a &#39;&#39;sledgehammer,&#39;&#39; pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive. . One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, &#39;&#39;Road to Resistance,&#39;&#39;( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. &#39;&#39;Oh, the bloody English!&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.&#39;&#39; . Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous. So did Odette Sansom, who refused to talk even when the Gestapo pulled out her toenails one by one. She was the first woman awarded the George Cross and was the subject of a 1951 movie that took its title from her first name. . Ms. Atkins, who did not marry and has no known survivors, worked to keep the memory of the Resistance alive. She was appointed a Commandant of the Legion of Honor in 1987. . She traveled a great deal, but settled in a cottage left her by an aunt at Winchelsea, from which, on a clear day, you can see France. . Editors&#39; Note: July 14, 2000, Friday An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times&#39;s research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications. Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins&#39;s background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins&#39;s retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased. . Editors’ Note: July 14, 2000 .

Within thy help and holy physic lies: . I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo, . My intercession likewise steads my foe. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; . Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift. . ROMEO . Then plainly know my heart&#39;s dear love is set . On the fair daughter of rich Capulet: . As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; . And all combined, save what thou must combine . By holy marriage: when and where and how . We met, we woo&#39;d and made exchange of vow, . I&#39;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, . That thou consent to marry us to-day. . FRIAR LAURENCE . Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! . Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear, . So soon forsaken? young men&#39;s love then lies . Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. . Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine . Hath wash&#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! . How much salt water thrown away in waste, . To season love, that of it doth not taste! . The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, . Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears; . Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit . Of an old tear that is not wash&#39;d off yet: . If e&#39;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine, . Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline: .

Intercession: praying for another person. . Friar states that young men’s love lies in his eyes, not his heart.

Friar thinks Romeo is being irrational by letting go of Rosaline after trying to get her to love him for so long. He thinks Romeo is being weak to allow himself to fall in love with another woman so quickly.

This type of conflict is inner conflict because it is Romeo vs his own passion for Juliet. I think Romeo is right to let Rosaline go because their relationship would never have worked out because it lacked true love. . Highlight the Friar’s warning in his final line. How is his warning similar to Juliet’s in Act 2.2 “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;/ Too like the lightning which doth cease to be” (Act 2.2 lines 129-130) . | Both statements are warnings to Romeo that imply that if their relationship moves too fast and without careful planning, it will start to crumble.

After Romeo hears the false news that Juliet is dead, he lies next to her sleeping body, preparing to kill himself for her: . 88   How oft when men are at the point of death  .  89   Have they been merry! which their keepers call   90   A lightning before death: O, how may I   91   Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!   92   Death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath,   93   Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: .  94   Thou art not conquer&#39;d; beauty&#39;s ensign yet   95   Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,  .  96   And death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there.  .  97   Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?   98   O, what more favor can I do to thee,  .  99   Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain  . 100   To sunder his that was thine enemy?  101   Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,  102   Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe  103   That unsubstantial death is amorous,  104   And that the lean abhorred monster keeps  105   Thee here in dark to be his paramour?  . 106   For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;  107   And never from this palace of dim night  108   Depart again. Here, here will I remain  109   With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here  110   Will I set up my everlasting rest,  111   And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars  112   From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!  113   Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you  114   The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss  . 115   A dateless bargain to engrossing death!             [Kisses Juliet, then speaks to the container of poison.]  . 116   Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!  117   Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on  . 118   The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!  119   Here&#39;s to my love!             [Drinks.]  119                                           O true apothecary!  120   Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.  . | Romeo is describing that Juliet is now dead but that death had not taken her beauty. This is verbal irony because Romeo says Juliet loses the sweet side of her( the honey) but states that she is still beautiful. . | This is a metaphor comparing poison to a guide. Romeo calls the poison a guide because he believes the poison will lead him to the afterlife where he could find Juliet. . | There are more words about death than the ones about love because this scene is Romeo talking about how death took Juliet and is now wanting death to take him as well.

Then I defy you, stars! (5,1,2830)” . Highlight lines 117-118. Compare the metaphor in these lines to Act 2.2.82-83 “I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far/ As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,/ I should adventure for such merchandise” In each line, the “pilot” (captain of a ship) is different. Explain the difference. . | The difference between the pilot in this scene and the pilot in Act 2.2.82-83 is that the pilot from act 2 is a new pilot that is ready for adventure. In this scene however, the pilot is now experienced and is now sick of his adventures. The pilot being Romeo, Romeo is sick of all the misery that is in his life and just wants to die to be with Juliet, his one true love. . Explain the effect of having Romeo directly talk to “death” in this monologue. . | Romeo directly talking to death affects the way the audience sees him.

Romeo and Juliet has led us astray: Romantic love, love at first sight – it’s great theater but disastrous dating advice. . February 14, 2010 | By Andrew Trees | . “Romeo and Juliet has Led us Astray” Notes, Annotations, Answers to questions . What if Shakespeare had it wrong about love in Romeo and Juliet? In fact, what if all of us have it wrong and our ideals of love and romance are hopelessly awry? Although we are supposed to be celebrating our love for that special someone on Valentine&#39;s Day, perhaps the time has come to reconsider the concept of romantic love, at least as it has been conceived in Western societies. . As we busily track down red roses, the best chocolates and the finest champagnes, we need to ask whether, in the pursuit of the perfect romance, we haven&#39;t declared war on true love. Cupid&#39;s arrow does strike often, but with the U.S. divorce rate near 50%, one has to wonder whether the wound is particularly deep or long-lasting. (Love) . As I found when researching my book on the science of human attraction, our typical romantic beliefs are quite often wrong. For instance, even couples who are blissfully happy together can&#39;t count on a happy ending. The PAIR project, a long-term academic study of couples, found that those most in love when they marry are also the most likely to get divorced. . And the chemical attraction that many people rely on to choose a partner has been found to fade &quot;to neutrality&quot; in two to three years. That&#39;s right, neutrality, which might work well for Switzerland but is deadly for a marriage. . Perhaps most damning of all, I discovered that wife murderers tend to be strong subscribers to the romantic ideal. Take that, Romeo and Juliet. . Love and romance did not always rule the roost. As recently as the 1930s, American men ranked mutual attraction as only the fourth most important quality for a relationship, while women had it even lower, placing it fifth (in a 1956 survey, women dropped it all the way to sixth). But in recent decades, love has climbed to No. 1, accompanied by a rise in the importance of looks, which suggests that our romance with romance is long on style and short on substance. . I hate to sound unromantic on this day of all days, but perhaps it&#39;s time to place less emphasis on romantic attraction as the key to finding a partner. What can shoulder some of the load? I would suggest that we rely a little more on what science has discovered about human attraction. . For instance, some researchers can now predict whether a couple will stay together with far more accuracy than the couple themselves. And it has less to do with the things we might think, such as fighting, and far more to do with the things we take for granted, such as asking your spouse about his or her day. . That doesn&#39;t mean we need to jettison every aspect of chemical attraction. Several studies have found that for women, a man&#39;s body odor is a helpful guide to finding a good genetic match (but only if the woman is not taking an oral contraceptive, which reverses her usual smell preferences). Body odor doesn&#39;t sound very romantic, but perhaps the better question to ask is: How did our narrow ideal of romantic love come to hold such complete sway in the first place? . Imagine a dating world turned on its head, in which people were not given the freedom to opt into or out of a relationship -- such as a culture that practices arranged marriages. What researchers have found will be shocking to Westerners weaned on the idea of romantic love. . According to a 1982 study by two Indian researchers, the level of self-reported love in arranged marriages increased over time until they surpassed the level of self-reported love in marriages that were freely chosen. Incredible as it sounds, people with a very limited say in choosing their own spouses eventually became happier with their relationships than people with the freedom to choose anyone they wanted. . Although we almost always read Romeo and Juliet as the quintessential story of love at first sight, Shakespeare actually offered his own sly critique of romantic love at the beginning of the play. Romeo is pining away for love -- but not for Juliet. There is another fair damsel who has rejected Romeo&#39;s advances, and he declares himself inconsolable. He disdains finding someone else and tells Benvolio, &quot;Thou canst not teach me to forget&quot; -- which is, of course, precisely what happens a few scenes later when Romeo meets Juliet and realizes that he was completely wrong before and only now has discovered true love. . We never remember that part of the story, though, because if we think of Romeo and Juliet from that perspective, the whole play starts to skew in ways that contradict our usual romantic notions. . Perhaps the time has come for us to take a skeptical view of romance, particularly the over-the-top variety peddled so effectively on Valentine&#39;s Day. We should throw off the shackles of our reigning romantic orthodoxy and realize that Romeo and Juliet and its many cultural offspring have led us astray. Shakespeare&#39;s story may be transcendent entertainment, but it is disastrous dating advice. .

In the video, I learned that people in the future could look at today’s superheroes and think of them as our culture. This also made me wonder if we are looking at past cultures in the same way that future cultures might be looking at us. It made me wonder if people hundreds or even thousands of years ago were as attached to their gods, legends, or heros as people of today are to theirs. Heros can show the value of a culture because heroes are looked at as an ideal or the best a person can be. People who look up to a hero also want to be as good as them or at least the best they themself can be. This is the reason heroes were made and why many people inbrance their ideas, heroes bring out the best part of a person. A person showing the best part of themself could become a real life hero and can make the world better and safer. . Journal #2 Date: 1/4/2022 . Courage is possibly the most common trait for a hero. Courage is going after something and knowing that the journey to it will be dangerous and that you might end up failing. The heroic part about courage is that the hero knows that what they are doing is dangerous but chooses to continue on the journey because they are doing it for the greater good. A person that is courageous is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. He chose to go into the death star to save princess Leia knowing he and his group were outnumbered and were mostly likely going to be overpowered. He even went back to help the rebels blow up the death star, still being outnumbered and overpowered. Luke did this because it was for the greater good and was worth the risk. Everyday people teach us that we want someone that has greater traits such as courage to be a leader and a face for our community. . Journal #3 Date:1/26/2022 . Act 2.2-2.3 Writing Practice .

If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.” – Ernest Hemingway . What Ernest is saying is that when someone loses their love, they become lonely. Love will never have a happy ending because no one can escape death and the lovers’ separation would lead to depression for the longer lasting lover and a tragic ending. This happened when Juliet kills herself after seeing Romeo dead(3.5.3122-3137). Juliet’s end is a tragic one because of the loss causing her to become depressed. .

Errors are bound to happen but identifying, understanding, and fixing thoses errors is what matters more. There are 4 main types of errors when developing a program. These are Logic, Syntax, run-time, and overflow errors. . Logic errors are errors that are caused due to the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm. This causes the program to behave unexpectedly. A logic error can result in events in the program taking place in times that they are not suppose to happen in. . | Syntax errors are very small mistakes made by the programmer that doesn&#39;t match with the language. It could be a typo, unnecessary code, missing necessary code, missing characters or added characters. Characters include colon, semicolon, parenthesis, indentations, quotes, and so much more. These mistakes will cause the program to shut down. . | Run-time errors happen when a program stops while it is running. This event is also known as &quot;crashing&quot; and the error is normally referred to as a &quot;bug&quot;. A run-time error can be caused by dividing by zero, wrong inputed data type, or many other errors that are commonly caused by incorrect data. . | Over-flow errors occur in a program when it is required to perform a calculation that is not possible for it to run. The values in the calculations are outside the set range of values of the program. This is caused due to memory allocation constraints of the program&#39;s language, resulting in restrictions. . | Ways to Correct Errors: . IDEs: Syntax errors are the easiest errors to fix because most IDEs display information on where and when there is a syntax error. . | Test Cases: Unlike syntax errors, logic errors are more difficult to found because the IDEs doesn&#39;t help you and it would normally look like nothing is wrong. This is when programmers use test cases. Test cases are a set of actions(like inputs) that are used to check if they get the correct result. . | Hand Tracing: Another testing strategy is hand tracing. Hand tracing is putting in values of variables in a loop to find out if the outcome is correct. This is most useful with loops and other small code segments that repeat a number of times. . | Extra Outputs: Lastly, a programmer could just add extra outputs. This strategy is used so that the programmer could find where the error is in the program. When the error is fixed, the extra output is normally removed. . | Testing a Program . Programmers are planning program tests at the beginning of development. They determine the program&#39;s specifications and inputs and ask themselves how will they know if the program is working correctly. The Defined inputs used to test the program demonstrate different outcomes that would be expected, no matter if it works or not. When the inputs and outputs are matched, the programers test the code. After the test, programmers use the infomation that the program give them and revise, refine, and/or improve their work. Then they test again, make more changes, test again, and again. Once the programmers made clear results that they wanted, they let users test it and make more changes from that. After all that, the program is finished and can be released but even still, most of the time they will still be changes that must be fixed. . Hacks: Test Planning . What errors may arise in your project? In program development, many errors eccour but most of them are small. These small errors could be an incorrect line of code, a typo, or a missed character. Most errors are like this but sometimes the error is bigger. Entire procedures can have the wrong purpose, code is typed using an incorrect language, program is set up incorrectly, and code could be blocked to some members of the team. All of these errors can break the entire code so ALL ERRORS MUST BE FIXED in our code. | . | What are some test cases that can be used? The desried inputs for my team&#39;s program would be english words but we must test more than that. Test cases that can be used would include any word from any language with any amount of letters as well as numbers or other special characters. This would mostly likely break the code and that is why my group must test them. It would be the best way to fix them. | . | .",

            "content": "Main Idea: Why should computing innovation have a purpose and what is it? . Computing innovation has a purpose because understanding the purpose of the innovation helps the developers improve their skills and ability to create the computing innovation they are working on. All computing innovations are builted with a purpose in mind because that is what guides the development process of the innovation. The purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or pursue interests. Most of the problems are not necessary but does make our daily lifes a lot easier. For the innovation made in this class, its purpose is to teach them about code and/or shown what they learned. . Inputs, Events, Actions, and Outputs: . Inputs are data that are sent into a computer for it to process through a given program. Forms of Input include text, numerical values, visual, tactile, and audio. Additionally, an event that triggers an action supplies a given input to the program it is in. A input can also be an action that triggers an event. To put it simiply, inputs can come from a user or other parts of the program. Event-driven programming results in program statements becoming active when triggered. The program can jump between code segment based on the event. Those events can be caused by anything; key pressed, mouse clicked, program started, timer, and many more. The inputs created normally affect other events and the output produced by a program. All of these types of inputs and events normally results in outputs. Program outputs are data sent from a program to the user or device. They can come in many different forms including but not limited to tactile, audio, visual, or text. Computer Programs take inputs in many different ways allowing them to influence the program&#39;s behavior differently. . Details About a Program: . A program is a collection of program statements that do a specific task when run. A program is also called software. A Program must be flexiable to work with different inputs and situations. The behavior of a program is how the program functions while it&#39;s running and is often affected by the user. A Program can be described based on what is does and also by how the program statements state the functions. A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. Focused on one specfic task. .",

            "content": "Important Notes from the Video: . Most college students feel a lot of anxiety and overwhelmed and results in them not having the free time to do the things they love. They are so stressed that they don’t focus on the college’s extra opportunities they offer. | College students sometimes miss out on what college has to offer because they feel stressed, anxious, lonely, and/or depressed. | It doesn’t matter how much you know about happiness and the actions needed to get it, if you don’t do those actions, you will never be any more happier. | It is hard to predict what will make us happy because what we think will create happiness, doesn’t make us happy enough. | The best way to create happiness is to permanently build daily habits. | A great way to maintain happiness is to make free time for social connections. It doesn’t need to be between friends or family, a social interaction with a stranger can boost your happiness a lot more than just being alone. | People feel more happy when they put in the time to help someone other than themselves. Sometimes a person gives something to someone else because that thing given to another person would have more value to them than to keep it themselves. | Most people look at their lives and focus on the negatives. Doesn’t matter how much of their life is positive, they only bring up the negatives. However, happy people do the opposite and focus on the positives. | A good way to force yourself to be happy is to simply just write down what you are grateful for whether that be a person, a thing, a situation, or your beliefs. | Staying physically healthy is tied to and is very efficient for staying mentally healthy. Best physical activities for having good mentally health are daily exercise and a good amount of sleep. | People need to focus on the moment they are currently in and notice what is making them happy right then and there. This ties into what was said about thinking about what you are grateful for. | Being wealthy in time is better than being wealthy with money because time allows for more socialization, freedom, and more chances to gain happiness. | . How to use the &#8220;Psychology and the Good Life&#8221;: . In order to get the good life that was described in the video, you must change your attitude, your habits, and your goals. People in today&#39;s society value their own productivity more than their mental health. They may feel more accomplished but that doesn’t make them happy. We also always think of what we don’t have and what we struggle with in our day to day lives. This attitude focuses so much on the negatives of life that the positive things that we should be grateful for are overshadowed. The best way to force yourself to be happy is to change your attitude and your habits. In order to put those forces in effect, you need to set up goals. Changes towards your attitude can include being more open to others, focusing on what you are grateful for, and trying new things. Some of the changes towards your habits include being more social, thinking about what you are grateful for, and exploring new experiences. Goals created that include the goal’s purpose, time measurement, and task are solid goals to use if you want to change yourself. To summarize, we need to change our mindset and habits in order to obtain a happy life because these are the two main factors that influence our mood and because if we don’t change them, we won’t become any happier. . Practice Activities: . I am grateful for . . . . My family | My friends | My food | My house | Access to great education | My teachers | Access to clean water | My good health | Access to technology. | . Goals used to increase my mental health and be happy: . Do well in school | focus more on the positives of things | Stay physically healthy | Help others | Make new friends | Don&#39;t let self-inflicted stress overwhelm me | Find the fun in everything. | . Notes of Gratitude: . To my friend, Abtin, I would like to thank you for being a friend and supporting me. You always were the one in any given group to bring the most fun. You introduced me to many activites that I still partaking in. You are also the sole reason I met many other people that I am still friends with to this day. I thank you for all you have done that has made me happy and I hope you are happy too. (Reaction: He was grateful for the note and stated that he was also grateful that we are friends.) . To my Mom and Dad, I would like to thank you for everything you have done for me. You guys have sacrificed so much just to raise me and to see me happy. You have given me the opportunities for me to grow in the way I most enjoyed. You guys have spend your time and energy into somethings just so I was able to succeed. You guys have loved me your whole life and I love you back. I thank you for everything and I hope that I have also given you what you wanted and more.

            "content": "Main idea: Why is collaboration important? . Collaboration is important because no one is perfect. Their are things we don&#39;t know how to do, can&#39;t do by ourself, or maybe not know the best choice out of multiple other choices. Many things in life are like this. You are assigned to do something that requires multiple different skills but you don&#39;t know all of them. However, collaborating with other people can help us with those problems. Collaboration allows for each person in a group to display their own set of skills while those skills connect to and support eachother in order to create a solution. This shows the people in a group their own strenghts and weaknesses. They can then learn from their individual weaknesses and from the weaknesses as a group in order to become better workers and teammates. Collaboration is important because no one is perfect, but we can collaborate in order to keep getting better and better. . When people are trying to create something or solve a problem, their is always bias. Everyone is bias and even a small amount of bias can affect a product or solution significantly. Fortunately, people collaborating together results in many different perspectives being expressed which results in everyone in the group becoming more open to new ideas. This open-minded thinking can result in a more effective product or solution. Colloboration helps decreases bias by having different perspectives in mind that can lead to the best possible outcome. . Collaboration displays: . an individual&#39;s skills/talents | an individual&#39;s ideas and perspective | the group&#39;s ideas and thinking | the group&#39;s teamwork skills Communication | Decision-making | Problem solving | Creating ideas | . | . Ways to collaborate in APCSP: . Pair-Programing: Pair programing is when two programers are given different roles and use their role to program. One role is called the driver and it is the person who is writing the code and the other role is the observer who reviews the lines of code as the driver types it. Helps with having a different perspective and new ideas. . Think-Pair-Share: Think-Pair-Share is a process where students think alone, share their ideas with a partner, and then share the ideas they and their partner came up with to the class. . Commenting on code: Commenting on code is used to communicate with yourself and your partners in order for you guys to gain a better understanding of the lines of code. This is when you would explain what the code does or should be doing. Comments are also a place to site sources to give credit and to look back at. It is also where you differentiate who did what code. . Tools: . repl.it: multiplayer(A place where multiply people can code at once.) | Github: collaboration with groups and repositories that allow you to save your work and have other people comment on your work. | Shared document or folder(you can share through google drive.) | Ask people to test out your program and for them to give feedback. | Check in with your teacher to talk about your code. | . Look back on these notes to get a reminder on what has to be done in order to properly collaborate in this class. .",

This blog will have the link to the AppLap quiz, the quiz&#39;s code, and also talk about the successes, discoveries, and challenges that occurred during the coding process. . Quiz Topic . Fortnite Battle Royale . Format . The quiz will start with a screen of its topic(fortnite) and show a &quot;Start Quiz&quot; button. Once that is pressed, the questions will be given. The quiz will have a total of 3 multiple choiced questions. Each of the questions will have their own screen that will display the correct answer along with 3 incorrect answers.

Success . The greatest success for me was me being able to easily understand how to make a quiz using block code. The code was basic which resulted in less complex work while also allowing it to be very clear to understand. The next time I use block code, I will remember that it is not too complicated and that I could try to import new ideas into my future codes with more ease. . Discoveries . I discovered that block coding and coding done in programs like python are very similar. This has allowed me to look at coding differently. Seeing line code simplified into blocks makes line code look easier to create. | I found out that the functions needed to create this quiz were very repetitive which made the coding process take less time. If I create another quiz like the one made here, I will use the same functions in order to have more time to create new ones. | Code.org explains what each of their blocks does by hovering over a block with the mouse. This has helped me whenever I got stuck. | . Challenges . While planning out the quiz with my parter, we were struggling to come up with a topic and then struggled to come up with quesitons for the topic. Thankfully, we got through that stage quickly and were able to get started on code.org. This taught me to choice a larger topic to focus on as it is easier to pull infomation from it. | During the coding process, I had trouble trying to display the score variable. I solved this by having each possible score output display its own screen. While this solution worked, I bielieve that there could have been another way that was easier. In the future, I will always make sure I choice the better solution and not just take the first one I find. | . . To summarize, this project has taught me much about block coding and that knowledge has enhanced my understand of code as a whole but I still have a lot to learn. .",

Wizard of Oz | Crossing the First Threshold- Dorothy lands in Oz and kills the Wicked Witch of the West with her house.

The Maze Runner | Crossing the First Threshold- Thomas enters the maze with Minho and Alby right when it closes and is stuck there for the night. He crosses from the ordinary world of the glade into the maze | Hero = Thomas, Thomas looks for a way out of the glade through the deadly maze and brings everyone out of the deadly maze and into the rest of the world. He sacrifices himself to find ways out and to save people. | . Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone | Crossing the First Threshold - Harry crosses the first threshold into the wizarding world when he first enters Diagon Alley. This is where he first experiences meeting wizards, buying his first wand, and going to Gringotts Bank. | Hero = Harry Potter, the predominant persona in the series, represents the “hero” archetype.

Hero’s Journey/Character Archetype Paragraph Date: 12/2/2021 Assign #6 . Writing a Two Chunk: Use this handout (it will ensure that you have all of the parts) . Support Thesis (aka Topic Sentence)– i.e. In the movie __, the character __ becomes a hero when __ (one of the stages). . In the movie Wreck it Ralph, the character Ralph displays the archetype hero when he faces obstacles that change and grow him as a person. Initially, Ralph is lonely, isolated, and misunderstood. He wants to be accepted and not seen as the bad guy anymore in his video game. He jumps into another video game to prove to everyone that he could be a hero by winning the prized medal. However, he ends up being transported to Sugar Rush Land where he meets Penelope. This is significant because Penelope plays a big part of Ralph’s evolution. She brings out traits and emotions in him that he never knew he had, such as: playfulness, protectiveness, love, and trustworthiness. She makes him realize that it’s better to have a true friend than a trophy. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #1 (you may paraphrase or quote the movie): . During the climax of the movie, Ralph sends himself and hundreds of mentos into a volcano of hot coke knowing that it would kill him but would also end up killing the Cy-bugs that were terrorizing Sugar Rush. . . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . This part of the movie is important because it proves that Ralph is the hero. In a movie that uses the hero’s journey, the definition of a hero is the character that needs to overcome an obstacle that ends up changing the character. In the beginning of the story, Ralph was selfish because he only wanted a medal so that he could get the approval from his co-workers. However, later on, he realized that having true friends is better than approval and that it is better to actually be a better person. This heroic act of sacrificing himself for the greater good displays the role of hero. . Lead-In AND Evidence/Concrete Detail #2: . Another example of when Ralph represents actions of a hero is when he learned that Penelope’s racing could cause her to lose her life. In order for this to not happen, Ralph decided that the best course of action was to destroy her racing car. . Commentary (2-3 sentences in your own words! Why is the quote/example significant? What does it tell about your main topic/main thesis? How does this quote prove your topic sentence? “This is significant/important because…” “This shows that…” “This is because”) . While this seems like a cruel act to do, he displays archetype hero traits of protection and love. Heroes often are faced with making hard decisions that may hurt people, but they do it with good intentions. Ralph destroyed Penelope’s car because he didn’t want to lose his only friend and would rather risk their friendship than her life. This is a selfless act often seen by archetypal heroes. . Concluding Sentence . In conclusion, Ralph is an archetypal hero in Wreck it Ralph because he evolves from being a self-centered lonely character to one that would sacrifice everything he values for the greater good. . Do Heroes Make us Smarter Date: 12/7/2021 Assignment#: 7 Close reading practice . Article Notes . Do Heroes Make Us Smarter? . Heroes give us direction, wisdom, and emotional intelligence. . By Scott T. Allison, Ph.D., Psychology Today, Apr 13, 2014 . When legendary South African President Nelson Mandela passed away in 2013, the world responded with heartache mixed with reverence. President Barack Obama observed that Mandela “no longer belongs to us. He belongs to the ages.” With this statement, Obama illustrated what we have always done to our greatest heroes—we forge them in eternity. . Why do we idolize great heroic leaders? Obviously, heroes provide us with hope and inspiration. But my research on heroes reveals a surprising finding—they make us smarter, too. Heroes improve our intelligence about the world and teach us lessons about the trajectory of our own lives. Our research has uncovered four ways that heroes impart wisdom to us. . 1. Heroes teach us how to respond in crisis situations . In 2007, Wesley Autrey, a construction worker living in Harlem, received international acclaim when he rescued a complete stranger from an oncoming New York subway train. Autrey witnessed the man fall on the subway tracks just as a train was approaching. Realizing he had no time to move the man from the tracks, Autrey made the remarkable decision to lie down on top of him in-between the rails as the train passed over them both. Only one-half inch separated Autrey from severe injury or death. . After performing this heroic act, Autrey received hundreds of letters from people thanking him for showing them how to live their lives and how to respond in emergency situations. Autrey and other selfless heroes like him teach us what to do, and the right thing to do, in challenging situations. Heroes like Autrey provide a script for heroic action to a world hungry for such a script. . 2. Hero stories illuminate paradoxical life truths . Spiritual guru Richard Rohr argues that hero stories are saturated with complex life truths that are nearly impossible for humans to grasp unless they are illustrated inside a good hero story. Many of these truths are paradoxical secrets of human growth and development. For example, in a typical hero story, the hero cannot grow as a person until after he or she has experienced a significant falling or failing. “Where you stumble,” wrote comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, “there lies your treasure.” Other paradoxical truths in hero stories include the wisdom that (a) we must leave home to find home; (b) we must lose ourselves in order to find ourselves; (c) we must surrender to win; and (d) we must give up something important to gain something important. . 3. Heroes teach us that their journey is the human journey . Joseph Campbell believed that the Hero’s Journey parallels human developmental stages. All young adults are driven out of their safe, familiar worlds and into the fearful real world. Psychologist Eric Erikson’s stages of human lifespan development suggest a hero trajectory during our lives, with young adults driven to establish competencies and carve out an identity for themselves. . Older adults reach a stage of generativity, which Erikson defines as people’s desire to create things that will outlast them and to give back to the society that has given them so much. Hero stories teach us that we are all developmentally equipped to pursue a lifelong hero-like journey. . 4. Heroes help us develop emotional intelligence . Psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim believed that children’s fairy tales are useful in helping people, especially children, understand emotional experience. The heroes of these fairy tales are usually subjected to dark, foreboding experiences, such as encounters with witches, evil spells, abandonment, neglect, abuse, and death. Listeners to these tales develop strategies for resolving their fears and distress. . Bettelheim believed that even the most distressing fairy tales, such as those by the Brothers Grimm, add clarity to confusing emotions and give people a greater sense of life’s meaning and purpose. The darkness of fairy tales allows children to grow emotionally, thus developing their emotional intelligence and preparing them for the challenges of adulthood. . Conclusion . Heroes give us far more than inspiration—they are our greatest teachers. Heroes show us the secrets to unlocking our fullest potential as human beings. They do so by role-modeling virtue, by clarifying complex and paradoxical life truths, by equipping us with emotional intelligence, and by revealing how their journey can be our journey, too. No wonder Obama said that Nelson Mandela “belongs to the ages.” The wisdom we get from our heroes has a timeless quality that helps us thrive as human beings. . | Purpose: To have an historic detail that supports their argument and can be relatable. .

Based on this article, why do you think the hero’s journey appeals to the human psyche? . Based on the article, the hero’s journey appeals to the human psyche because humans want to leave something behind when they are gone and the hero’s journey’s most common reward is being remembered for something great. That is just what humans want. . Give an example of someone who you believe is heroic and how this person has guided you. .

Vera Atkins, 92, Spymaster for British, Dies . By Douglas Martin published in the New York Times, June 27, 2000 . Article Annotations . Vera Atkins, who recruited, trained and watched over the legendary British secret agents who parachuted into France to sabotage the Nazis in World War II, died on Saturday in Hastings, Sussex. She was 92. . Although Ian Fleming never identified her, Ms. Atkins was widely believed to have inspired the character of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond series. She was principal assistant to Col. Maurice Buckmaster, director of the Special Operations Executive, who is said to have been the model for &#39;&#39;M.&#39;&#39; . But Ms. Atkins&#39;s steel-trap intelligence and fierce loyalty to agents who had been warned their chances of surviving were barely one in two were a far cry from Miss Moneypenny&#39;s lovestruck mooning over the elusive Bond. Ms. Atkins&#39;s heart was with her 400 secret agents. She stood on the runway to watch each take off to parachute into France. . After the war, when the tally of lost agents turned out to be a little worse than 1 in 4, Ms. Atkins pushed to be assigned to investigate each of the 118 cases. She traced 117, all dead, and brought their surviving killers to war crimes trials. The 118th had been, unknown to her, a compulsive gambler who vanished not far from Monte Carlo while carrying three million francs of secret service money. . &#39;&#39;I could not just abandon their memory,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;I decided we must find out what happened to each one, and where.&#39;&#39; . She spent nearly a year questioning officers from concentration camps and poring over records. &#39;&#39;I was probably the only person who could do this,&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;You had to know every detail of the agents, names, code names, every hair on their heads, to spot their tracks.&#39;&#39; . The confessions she obtained from the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Hoess, were used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials. She always shuddered at Hoess&#39;s reaction to her suggestion that 1.5 million people had been killed in Auschwitz. . &#39;&#39;Oh no,&#39;&#39; he said, as if offended. &#39;&#39;It was 2,345,000.&#39;&#39; . Ms. Atkins was born Vera Maria Rosenberg in Bucharest, Romania, and went to London with her parents in 1933, where she adopted her mother&#39;s last name. She studied modern languages at the Sorbonne and went to finishing school at Lausanne. Her perfect French and her just as perfect manners would come in handy later. . At the outbreak of the war, she joined the Special Operations Executive, which Winston Churchill set up &#39;&#39;to set Europe ablaze&#39;&#39; through sabotage and subversion. The unit started slowly. But after victory in Europe, Dwight D. Eisenhower said, &#39;&#39;It was the equivalent of 15 divisions.&#39;&#39; . Hitler said, &#39;&#39;When I get to London I am not sure who I shall hang first -- Churchill or that man Buckmaster.&#39;&#39; . Hitler, perhaps, did not know about Buckmaster&#39;s assistant, Ms. Atkins. . The spymasters headed the unit&#39;s F section, for France. They began by interviewing candidates in a hotel room with a desk, two chairs and a lightbulb. After the initial questioning, they had a general conversation in French to see whether the applicant could pass as a native. Each successful candidate was told that he had a 50-50 chance of survival and given a few days to think about it. . The recruits were a remarkable cross-section -- bankers and playwrights, chefs and taxicab drivers. Gen. Charles de Gaulle had insisted that the unit not recruit French citizens, while demanding that he control the agents. Most of those selected were half-French British citizens. . The initial training was at a 16th-century country house where they had no contact with the outside world. Next came a commando course in the Scottish Highlands, where they learned about guns and explosives. Then there was a survival course in Hampshire, followed by parachute training near Manchester. . They were given practice in being interrogated and keeping up their cover stories by going over and over their false identities and backgrounds. . It was Ms. Atkins who briefed the agents in minute detail on how to live in occupied France with its curfew and regulations. They were given continental clothing and French mementos, ticket stubs, letters and keepsakes to put in their pockets. . At last, they were dropped in France, to be met by reception committees. Each evening, they received their orders in coded personal messages broadcast after the news on the BBC French Service. . Ms. Atkins had no rank, but the blunt force of her personality, described by The Times of London as a &#39;&#39;sledgehammer,&#39;&#39; pervaded the operation. She worked 18-hour days. A British television documentary in 1997 reported that she sent off each agent with the brisk shout of a French expletive. . One agent, George Millar, recalled in his autobiography, &#39;&#39;Road to Resistance,&#39;&#39;( Little, Brown, 1980), how she had reacted to his falling in love -- again. &#39;&#39;Oh, the bloody English!&#39;&#39; she said. &#39;&#39;We never have bother of this sort with the French. They just copulate, and that is that.&#39;&#39; . Usually she remained in the shadows. But the accounts of some heroes whom she controlled eventually came to the fore. Four agents were captured separately, given fatal injections and burned in ovens. Violette Szabo, who was tortured and shot, became famous.

Editors&#39; Note: July 14, 2000, Friday An obituary on June 27 about Vera Atkins, who recruited and trained British secret agents sent to France in World War II, reported on her education and upbringing, the methods she used to help train the agents and her intense loyalty to them. The 1,000-word article was based substantially on The Times&#39;s research in books, but some information came as well from The Times of London and other British publications. Five brief passages in the obituary closely reflected the phrasing of an obituary in The Times of London. These were references to Ms. Atkins&#39;s background, to her attempts to trace missing agents, to the training regimen for agents and to Ms. Atkins&#39;s retirement. Although the London paper was cited as a source for some material, those five passages should also have been attributed to it, or should have been rephrased. . Editors’ Note: July 14, 2000 .

Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes. . Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine . Hath wash&#39;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline! . How much salt water thrown away in waste, .

The Friar and Romeo disagree about the validity of Romeo’s love. What reason does Romeo offer for the validity of his love? Why does the Friar think that Roseline scorned Romeo? What type of conflict is this? Who is right- Romeo or the Friar? Why? . | Romeo defends his logic on love by claiming that Rosaline never truly loved him and he found someone who truly loved him back. Friar thinks that Roseline scorned Romeo because he thought Romeo was so committed to making Rosaline love him that the only way Romeo would leave her was if she broke his heart. This type of conflict is inner conflict because it is Romeo vs his own passion for Juliet. I think Romeo is right to let Rosaline go because their relationship would never have worked out because it lacked true love. . Highlight the Friar’s warning in his final line. How is his warning similar to Juliet’s in Act 2.2 “It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;/ Too like the lightning which doth cease to be” (Act 2.2 lines 129-130) . | Both statements are warnings to Romeo that imply that if their relationship moves too fast and without careful planning, it will start to crumble. Relationships shouldn’t be rushed if they are to be long lasting. . What message is being developed about love? . | You should be true to yourself and find true love. Love shouldn’t be rushed. Love comes in unexpected ways and can cause your heart to take over your brain. . Romeo and Juliet Evidence Sandwich Date: 1/28/2022 Assignment #19 .

After Romeo hears the false news that Juliet is dead, he lies next to her sleeping body, preparing to kill himself for her: . 88   How oft when men are at the point of death  .  89   Have they been merry! which their keepers call   90   A lightning before death: O, how may I   91   Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!   92   Death, that hath suck&#39;d the honey of thy breath,   93   Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty: .  94   Thou art not conquer&#39;d; beauty&#39;s ensign yet   95   Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,  .  96   And death&#39;s pale flag is not advanced there.  .  97   Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?   98   O, what more favor can I do to thee,  .  99   Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain  . 100   To sunder his that was thine enemy?  101   Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,  102   Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe  103   That unsubstantial death is amorous,  104   And that the lean abhorred monster keeps  105   Thee here in dark to be his paramour?  . 106   For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;  107   And never from this palace of dim night  108   Depart again. Here, here will I remain  109   With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here  110   Will I set up my everlasting rest,  111   And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars  112   From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!  113   Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you  114   The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss  . 115   A dateless bargain to engrossing death!             [Kisses Juliet, then speaks to the container of poison.]  . 116   Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!  117   Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on  . 118   The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!  119   Here&#39;s to my love!             [Drinks.]  119                                           O true apothecary!  120   Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.  . | Romeo is describing that Juliet is now dead but that death had not taken her beauty. This is verbal irony because Romeo says Juliet loses the sweet side of her( the honey) but states that she is still beautiful. . | This is a metaphor comparing poison to a guide. Romeo calls the poison a guide because he believes the poison will lead him to the afterlife where he could find Juliet. . | There are more words about death than the ones about love because this scene is Romeo talking about how death took Juliet and is now wanting death to take him as well. Him referring to death a lot makes it sound like he is calling for death and is begging for death to take him to Juiliet. . | | .

Find one other example in the play and write it down. Cite your example with act, scene, and line numbers. . | Inauspicious stars are the stars in the sky that result in someone’s unlucky fate. Romeo saying this is him saying that he is breaking free from his fate by killing himself. After hearing the false news about Juliet’s death and believing in it, Romeo says “Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars! (5,1,2830)” . Highlight lines 117-118. Compare the metaphor in these lines to Act 2.2.82-83 “I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far/ As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,/ I should adventure for such merchandise” In each line, the “pilot” (captain of a ship) is different. Explain the difference. . | The difference between the pilot in this scene and the pilot in Act 2.2.82-83 is that the pilot from act 2 is a new pilot that is ready for adventure. In this scene however, the pilot is now experienced and is now sick of his adventures. The pilot being Romeo, Romeo is sick of all the misery that is in his life and just wants to die to be with Juliet, his one true love. . Explain the effect of having Romeo directly talk to “death” in this monologue. . | Romeo directly talking to death affects the way the audience sees him. Romeo, who is so excited to take on the world in the first part of the play is now begging death to take him to Juliet. This shows that Juliet is now Romeo’s world and that Romeo would do anything to get back to it. . Close Reading and Writing Practice Act 3.5.1-16 Date: 2/10/2022 Assignment: 23 .

Romeo: It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east: Night&#39;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.

Juliet: Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I: It is some meteor that the sun exhales, To be to thee this night a torch-bearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua: (15) Therefore stay yet; thou need&#39;st not to be gone. . | Jocund: lighthearted and cheerful. .

By doing this, Romeo might stay with Juliet a little longer. . Compare and contrast this scene to the balcony scene (2.2). Think about what Romeo thought when he saw Juliet? Explain what he thought. What is Juliet trying to do here? . | When Romeo saw Juliet in the balcony in act 2 scene 2, he referred to her as a holy person with great beauty, like an angel. In this act, Juliet is trying to convince Romeo to stay with her for a little longer. This is Juliet calling for a person he needs, which makes it now Juliet referring to Romeo as an angel. .

Romeo and Juliet has led us astray: Romantic love, love at first sight – it’s great theater but disastrous dating advice. . February 14, 2010 | By Andrew Trees | . “Romeo and Juliet has Led us Astray” Notes, Annotations, Answers to questions . What if Shakespeare had it wrong about love in Romeo and Juliet? In fact, what if all of us have it wrong and our ideals of love and romance are hopelessly awry? Although we are supposed to be celebrating our love for that special someone on Valentine&#39;s Day, perhaps the time has come to reconsider the concept of romantic love, at least as it has been conceived in Western societies. . As we busily track down red roses, the best chocolates and the finest champagnes, we need to ask whether, in the pursuit of the perfect romance, we haven&#39;t declared war on true love. Cupid&#39;s arrow does strike often, but with the U.S. divorce rate near 50%, one has to wonder whether the wound is particularly deep or long-lasting. (Love) . As I found when researching my book on the science of human attraction, our typical romantic beliefs are quite often wrong. For instance, even couples who are blissfully happy together can&#39;t count on a happy ending. The PAIR project, a long-term academic study of couples, found that those most in love when they marry are also the most likely to get divorced. . And the chemical attraction that many people rely on to choose a partner has been found to fade &quot;to neutrality&quot; in two to three years. That&#39;s right, neutrality, which might work well for Switzerland but is deadly for a marriage. . Perhaps most damning of all, I discovered that wife murderers tend to be strong subscribers to the romantic ideal. Take that, Romeo and Juliet. . Love and romance did not always rule the roost. As recently as the 1930s, American men ranked mutual attraction as only the fourth most important quality for a relationship, while women had it even lower, placing it fifth (in a 1956 survey, women dropped it all the way to sixth). But in recent decades, love has climbed to No. 1, accompanied by a rise in the importance of looks, which suggests that our romance with romance is long on style and short on substance. . I hate to sound unromantic on this day of all days, but perhaps it&#39;s time to place less emphasis on romantic attraction as the key to finding a partner. What can shoulder some of the load? I would suggest that we rely a little more on what science has discovered about human attraction. . For instance, some researchers can now predict whether a couple will stay together with far more accuracy than the couple themselves. And it has less to do with the things we might think, such as fighting, and far more to do with the things we take for granted, such as asking your spouse about his or her day. . That doesn&#39;t mean we need to jettison every aspect of chemical attraction. Several studies have found that for women, a man&#39;s body odor is a helpful guide to finding a good genetic match (but only if the woman is not taking an oral contraceptive, which reverses her usual smell preferences). Body odor doesn&#39;t sound very romantic, but perhaps the better question to ask is: How did our narrow ideal of romantic love come to hold such complete sway in the first place? . Imagine a dating world turned on its head, in which people were not given the freedom to opt into or out of a relationship -- such as a culture that practices arranged marriages. What researchers have found will be shocking to Westerners weaned on the idea of romantic love. . According to a 1982 study by two Indian researchers, the level of self-reported love in arranged marriages increased over time until they surpassed the level of self-reported love in marriages that were freely chosen. Incredible as it sounds, people with a very limited say in choosing their own spouses eventually became happier with their relationships than people with the freedom to choose anyone they wanted. . Although we almost always read Romeo and Juliet as the quintessential story of love at first sight, Shakespeare actually offered his own sly critique of romantic love at the beginning of the play. Romeo is pining away for love -- but not for Juliet. There is another fair damsel who has rejected Romeo&#39;s advances, and he declares himself inconsolable. He disdains finding someone else and tells Benvolio, &quot;Thou canst not teach me to forget&quot; -- which is, of course, precisely what happens a few scenes later when Romeo meets Juliet and realizes that he was completely wrong before and only now has discovered true love. . We never remember that part of the story, though, because if we think of Romeo and Juliet from that perspective, the whole play starts to skew in ways that contradict our usual romantic notions. . Perhaps the time has come for us to take a skeptical view of romance, particularly the over-the-top variety peddled so effectively on Valentine&#39;s Day. We should throw off the shackles of our reigning romantic orthodoxy and realize that Romeo and Juliet and its many cultural offspring have led us astray. Shakespeare&#39;s story may be transcendent entertainment, but it is disastrous dating advice. .

What have you learned from this article? I learned that Shakespeare’s love in the play Romeo and Juliet is leading us away from real love and happiness and that you shouldn’t take dating advice from his plays because of it.

In the video, I learned that people in the future could look at today’s superheroes and think of them as our culture. This also made me wonder if we are looking at past cultures in the same way that future cultures might be looking at us. It made me wonder if people hundreds or even thousands of years ago were as attached to their gods, legends, or heros as people of today are to theirs. Heros can show the value of a culture because heroes are looked at as an ideal or the best a person can be. People who look up to a hero also want to be as good as them or at least the best they themself can be. This is the reason heroes were made and why many people inbrance their ideas, heroes bring out the best part of a person. A person showing the best part of themself could become a real life hero and can make the world better and safer. . Journal #2 Date: 1/4/2022 . Courage is possibly the most common trait for a hero. Courage is going after something and knowing that the journey to it will be dangerous and that you might end up failing. The heroic part about courage is that the hero knows that what they are doing is dangerous but chooses to continue on the journey because they are doing it for the greater good. A person that is courageous is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. He chose to go into the death star to save princess Leia knowing he and his group were outnumbered and were mostly likely going to be overpowered. He even went back to help the rebels blow up the death star, still being outnumbered and overpowered. Luke did this because it was for the greater good and was worth the risk. Everyday people teach us that we want someone that has greater traits such as courage to be a leader and a face for our community. . Journal #3 Date:1/26/2022 . Act 2.2-2.3 Writing Practice .

If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.” – Ernest Hemingway . What Ernest is saying is that when someone loses their love, they become lonely. Love will never have a happy ending because no one can escape death and the lovers’ separation would lead to depression for the longer lasting lover and a tragic ending. This happened when Juliet kills herself after seeing Romeo dead(3.5.3122-3137). Juliet’s end is a tragic one because of the loss causing her to become depressed. .

            "title": "Unit 1.3 Program, Design, and Development Notes",
            "content": "The Development Process: . All programs are created because there was an idea. That idea is what gives the program a certain purpose. The best way developers turn their ideas into reality is by sticking to it and following a clear set of steps to create it. However, these steps are more of a guideline. The development of a program is a lot more exploratory and steps are normally followed based on what happens during development but some steps are essential. . First, the developers must observe the purpose or problem and then reflect on it. Here is where the developers gain an understanding of the requirements, constraints, and users interest. They can obtain this infomation by testing users, creating surveys, hosting interviews, or observing others. . | After observing, reflecting, and investigating, developers starts to plan how to build the program. This is when they start brainstorming ideas, planning out the code, and create a testing strategy on their work. . | Once the program has been made, the developers talk about how the program behaves and what it should do. They will test their program with outside users. They will look back at their work to make sure it meet all the requirements and put it in a prototype. This will allow the developers to make changes while running the framework. . | Now for the test. This might be the final step, but testing occurs during every step of the development process. Testing occurs on different levels including micro and macro. Finally, developers revisit and refine their program baesd on what was shown after the test, feedback provided from users, and their reflection on what they wanted the program to do. . | Acknowledgement in a Program . Program development is normally used by teams of people and is rarely done alone. Indivduals or smaller teams formed in a team would work on different components of the code. With many people working on the same program, all of them deserve to receive credit for their work. Their names must be written in the program and at the part of the code they worked on. A good place to give credit in a program is through comments. Comments can also direct people to the creater of the code segment to ask for help or to tell them that something is wrong. Speaking of lines of code, most of the time, developers use existing code segments, procedures, and algorithms to write their own program. The people that made the existing code are not part of the project but should still get credit. It should be documented by the author&#39;s name and where the code came from. . Program Documentation . Programmers create program documentation that is a description of the functions of code segments, events, roles, methods, procedures, or the whole program and how all of it was created. Program documentation is most commonly found in the code language&#39;s comments. Comments can be read by anyone in the code and have no affect on the program. Comments are a great tool because it is inside the code making it very easy to access. This helps programmers document their development at all times which is something everyone should be doing. The purpose of program documentation is to help development and maintain the program based on the description/infomation contained in it. Program documentation happens at anytime during development. At the beginning, developers list off the specifications of the program. During the production, developers track their process, issues, and successes. After the production, developers explain the overall process of their code and how it affects the whole program. . My Group Project Info: . Main Idea about the Project: . Me and my Group have decided to code a program that will simulate a game of hangman. Hangman is a game between two or more players. One player known as the executioner thinks up of a word or a sentence and at least one other person needs to guess what that word or sentence might be going one letter at a time. If the guesser(s) guess a letter that is not in the phase, the executioner draws a body part of a stick figure onto a gallow. If the executioner draws all the body parts, the guessers lose and the game is over. If the guessers complete the phase, they win. | . . | Purpose of Program: . The Purpose of this program is to teach and/or test the user&#39;s vocabulary skills. This is done through hangman by displaying a definition of the unknown word or by displaying a topic that relates to the unknown sentence. They must have good vocabalury skills to win the game as well as good grammer. | . . | Brainstormed Ideas: . The game is going to be like traditional hangman but there are ideas that will make the coding more interesting and make it more fun for the user. . Timer: A timer can be added to the game to make it feel more fast paced. A timer will reset every time the user guesses a letter, no matter if it is right or wrong. If the timer finishes before the user guesses, it will automatically draw a body part and reset. . | Definition: A text box of the definition of the unknown word will appear. This definition will guide the user into guessing the correct word. . | | . . | Requirements and Constraints: . The requirement is to create a program with a eductional purpose and present it in class by the end of the trimester. It also must be a project that the group will not lose interest in in a few weeks. This will mean the project must be updated throughout the weeks even after the main code is complete. The biggest constraint for building this program is time. Me and my group only have a few weeks to create the code and are expected to receive many other assignments that might give us less time. That plus the lack of knowledge and experience. However, the point of this assignment is to enhance our knowledge and provide the coders with experience so this is less of a constraint and more of a learning opportunity. | . . | Project&#39;s Impact: The Project will have an impact on the coders and the users. It will impact the coders because it will provide them with knowledge and experince about code. It will impact the users because it should be able to enhance their vocabulary and some rules about grammer and words. | . | . .",
