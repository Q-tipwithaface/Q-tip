<td>Program Purpose and Function</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>I gave this part a 1 because the student was very straightforward in their responses resulting in no places where the student would do something they were not allowed to do. The submission also meets all the requirements.</td>

<tr>
<td>Managing Complexity</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>I gave this part a 0 because the student’s code uses variables present in the list but as a result, provided nothing that shows the importance of those variables in that list. The list is not used in the given code segments and the variables it used does not need to be located in that list. For the variables and list given, it is shown that the list is irrelevant and provides nothing to this part of the code.</td>

<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>I gave this part a 1 because the algorithm given is properly explained as well as showing step by step process on how to recreate it. The algorithm uses sequencing, selection, and iteration through if statements and for loops.</td>

<td>I gave this part a 1 because all the requirements are meant. Even though the two parameters start at the same code segment, one of them bypassed another code segment that the other parameters go through, making it ok to use.</td>

</h2>
<p>For these two examples, a submission is most likely to fail to meet the standard by not properly explaining the purpose of a list, code segments, or the entire program. This shows that there must be a clear purpose for a program and why the purpose is important in order to meet college board expectations.</p>
